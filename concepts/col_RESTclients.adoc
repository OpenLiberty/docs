= Understanding REST clients

The acronym REST stands for Representational State Transfer, a methodology in which each unique URL is a representation of an object. You can access and manipulate the object using HTTP operations: GET to retrieve it, DELETE to delete it, POST to create it, or PUT to update it. REST is becoming more and more popular across many types of businesses because of its strong advantages:

* Lightweight - requests and responses can be short and require less bandwidth
* Human readable results
* Easy to build - there is less reliance on toolkits
* Concise - no need for additional messaging layer

However, REST is not ideal in certain scenarios, such as when you need to include secure data in a request. Which method is best depends on the needs of your client application and its users. For more information on REST vs. SOAP, consult a third-party text.

== What you can do with RESTful services

The operations supported are listed in the REST Services Documentation.

* search and retrieve member and relationship data (memsearch, memget, relsearch, relget)
* edit, add and delete member and relationship data (memput, memputqual, relput, memdelete, memundelete, reldelete, memdrop)
* undo recent put, merge or delete record operations (MEMUNDO)
* compare and score member data (memcompare, memscore)
* merge and unmerge member records (memmerge, memunmerge)
* member, entity, attribute and field labels
* member attribute order
* member, entity and attribute display templates
* member and entity default composite views

== MicroProfile REST client

MicroProfile can be organized into three layers of functionality. The bottom layer represents REST services, the middle layer is for scaling towards hundreds of microservices, and the top layer contains tools to help you detect and diagnose issues.

== Build REST services with Java

The JAX-RS, CDI, JSON-B and JSON-P Java EE technologies provide the base for MicroProfile. If you're new to Java EE and MicroProfile, this is a good place to start. JAX-RS is a Java API that allows you to build REST APIs by creating resource classes and adding appropriate annotations to create the necessary web endpoints. Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) provides objects with the dependencies that they need through the `@Inject` annotation rather than directly creating an object or finding them using a factory. JSON-P and JSON-B makes it easy to automatically serialize and deserialize classes to and from JSON.

== Consuming a REST service with type-safe Java
MicroProfile Rest Client provides a type-safe approach for invoking REST services over HTTP. This API greatly simplifies the client-side API as defined by JAX-RS. MicroProfile Rest Client handles the communication between the client and service. You only need to define and annotate an interface that describes the actions that you need to perform on a REST resource. An implementation of this interface is automatically generated for you when CDI is used to inject your client into a dependent class.

== Where to next?

Now that you’ve seen the tools that MicroProfile provides for creating and managing microservices, you’re probably itching to try them out yourself!
