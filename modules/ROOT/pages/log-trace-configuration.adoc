= Log and trace configuration

Open Liberty has a unified logging component that handles messages that are written by applications and the runtime, and provides First Failure Data Capture (FFDC) capability. Logging data that is written by applications by using the `System.out`, `System.err`, or `java.util.logging.Logger` streams is combined into the server logs.

A server has three primary log files:

- `console.log` - This file is created by the `server start` command. It contains the redirected standard output and standard error streams from the JVM process. This console output is formatted for human readability and it lacks some information that is useful for automated log analysis.
- `messages.log` - This file contains all messages that are written or captured by the logging component. All messages that are written to this file contain additional information such as the message timestamp and the ID of the thread that wrote the message. This file is suitable for automated log analysis. This file does not contain messages that are written directly by the JVM process.
- `trace.log` - This file contains all messages that are written or captured by the logging component and any enabled trace. This file is created only if you enable trace. This file does not contain messages that are written directly by the JVM process.

The following sections provide more information about configuring your Open Liberty logs:

[#configuaration]
== Logging configuration
The logging component can be controlled through the server configuration. The logging component can be fully configured in your `server.xml` file by the `logging` element. However, logging is initialized before the `server.xml` file is processed so configuring logging through the `server.xml` file can result in early log entries that use a different log configuration from later ones. To avoid this problem, you can provide much of the logging configuration in the `boostrap.properties` file and in some cases by using environment variables.

[#storage]
== Log file storage management
The `console.log` file is created by redirecting the process `stdout` and `stderr` streams to a file. As a result, Open Liberty is unable to offer the same level of management, like log rollover, as it offers for the `messages.log` file. If you are concerned about the size of the `console.log` file, you can disable the `console.log` file and use the `messages.log` file instead. All the log messages that are sent to the `console.log` file are written to the `messages.log` file, and you can configure file rollover in the messages log.

To disable the console log, and configure the `messages.log` file to roll over three times at 100 Mb, you can use the following configuration:

[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
com.ibm.ws.logging.max.file.size=100
com.ibm.ws.logging.max.files=3
com.ibm.ws.logging.console.log.level=OFF
com.ibm.ws.logging.copy.system.streams=false
----

[#json]
== JSON logging
You can simplify log parsing by producing your logs in JSON format. JSON is a self-describing format that many log analysis tools can consume without requiring format-specific parsing instructions. You can configure Open Liberty logs to produce logs in JSON format either by editing the `bootstrap.properties` file or by specifying an environment variable. The following two examples show the configuration for each of these options:

* Configure JSON logging in the `bootstrap.properties` file:
+
[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
com.ibm.ws.logging.message.format=json
com.ibm.ws.logging.message.source=message,trace,accessLog,ffdc,audit
----
+
* Configure JSON logging with environment variables in the `server.env` file:
+
[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT=json
WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE=message,trace,accessLog,ffdc,audit
----

[#names]
=== Configurable JSON field names
When logs are in JSON format, you can use the `jsonFieldMappings` attribute to replace default field names with new field names. Replacing the default field names might be necessary if other servers in the same logging configuration use different field names than the Open Liberty default names. For example, an Open Liberty message is referred to by the `message` field name, but the message in another container might be in a field called `log`. In this case, two different visualizations of the messages show in the logs on a dashboard. If you modify the Open Liberty output field name so that it matches the other log, you can view them in the same visualization. The following examples show sample configurations for renaming a JSON field.

* To configure a new field name, you can include the following environmental variable in the `server.env` file:
+
[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
WLP_LOGGING_JSON_FIELD_MAPPINGS=loglevel:level
----
+
In this example, the `loglevel` field name is replaced by the `level` field name.


* To configure a field name for a specific source, you can include the following environmental variable in the `server.env` file:
+
[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
WLP_LOGGING_JSON_FIELD_MAPPINGS=message:message:log
----
+
In this example, the `message` field name is replaced by the `log` field name in the message log.

To omit a field from the logs, specify the field name without a replacement, as shown in the following example:

----
WLP_LOGGING_JSON_FIELD_MAPPINGS=defaultFieldName:
----

To rename or omit multiple fields, specify a comma-separated list of field name mappings.

For a full list of the default JSON field names, see xref:json-log-events-list.adoc[the JSON log events reference list].

For more information, see link:/blog/2019/10/11/configure-logs-JSON-format-190010.html#jlog[Configurable JSON log field names].

[#fields]
=== Custom message and trace JSON fields

You can add custom fields to your JSON-formatted message and trace output to gather information about a particular issue or incident. For example, if you want to check the requests from a specific user, you can add a custom field to filter application logs by that userâ€™s ID. You can add another field for the session ID so that you can analyze and filter application logs for a specific session.

The Open Liberty `LogRecordContext` API can add custom fields to your log and trace records. This API adds a field by specifying a value for an extension. To use the `LogRecordContext` API, first import the `com.ibm.websphere.logging.hpel.LogRecordContext` class. The following examples show how to add different kinds of custom fields to your JSON logs.

To add a string-valued field to your application logs, you can include the following line in your application:

[source,java]
----
LogRecordContext.addExtension("userName","bob");
----

The newly specified field is added to log and trace entries that are created on the same thread that executes the `addExtension` method. In this example, a custom field that is called `userName` is added for the `bob` user ID.

To add fields with boolean, float, int, or long values, the extension name must include the suffixes `_bool`, `_float`, `_int`, or `_long`, as shown in the following examples:

[source,java]
----
LogRecordContext.addExtension("extensionName_bool","true");
LogRecordContext.addExtension("extensionName_int","112233");
LogRecordContext.addExtension("extensionName_float","1.2");
LogRecordContext.addExtension("extensionName_long","132");
----

When you specify these suffixes to add non-string values, the resulting JSON field values are not enclosed in quotes in the logs. Only string-valued JSON field values are enclosed in quotes in the logs.

To remove custom fields from the logs, use the following method:

[source,java]
----
LogRecordContext.removeExtension(extensionName);
----

After you remove an extension, JSON output for subsequent logs and trace that are made on the same thread do not include that field.

[#http]
=== Selectable HTTP access log JSON fields
When logs are in JSON format and the `accessLog` source is specified, you can replace the default HTTP access log JSON fields with a different set of fields. You can use the `jsonAccessLogFields` attribute to specify whether your access logs use the default fields or a set of fields that is specified by the `logFormat` attribute. You specify the replacement fields in the `logFormat` attribute of the `accessLogging` element within the `httpEndpoint` element.

With this configuration, you can receive information that is otherwise not available in JSON logs, such as the remote user ID, request headers, and more. These logs can be used by log analysis tools, such as the Elastic stack, to monitor your server. For more information about HTTP access log format options, see xref:access-logging.adoc[HTTP access logging].

The following example shows a configuration in the `server.xml` file to replace the default HTTP access log fields with fields that are specified by the `logFormat` attribute. xref:access-logging.adoc[HTTP access logging] must be enabled to receive JSON access logs.

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" id="defaultHttpEndpoint">
    <accessLogging logFormat='%R{W} %u %{my_cookie}C %s'/>
</httpEndpoint>
<logging jsonAccessLogFields="logFormat"/>
----


[#docker]
== Docker image logging configuration

In Docker environments, you can disable the messages log and format the console output as JSON by using environment variables, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT=json
WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE=
WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT=json
WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL=info
WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE=message,trace,accessLog,ffdc,audit
----

You can specify this configuration when you run the `docker run` command by using the `-e` flag to set the environment variables:

[role='command']
```
docker run -e "WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE=message,trace,accessLog,ffdc"
           -e "WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT=json"
           -e "WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL=info"
           -e "WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT=json"
           -e "WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE=" open-liberty
```

[#binary]
== Binary logging

Liberty has a high-performance binary log format option that reduces the resources that are needed to write trace files. Generally, when you configure binary logging, the `console.log` is disabled for best performance. You can configure binary logging in the `bootstrap.properties` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
websphere.log.provider=binaryLogging-1.0
com.ibm.ws.logging.console.log.level=OFF
com.ibm.ws.logging.copy.system.streams=false
----

The `binaryLog` command-line tool can be used to convert the binary log to a text file:

[role='command']
----
binaryLog view defaultServer
----

== Log formats

TBASIC logging format::

The TBASIC logging format provides a consistent log format across your Open Liberty console log, message log, and trace log files.
A BASIC logging format exists for `traceFormat`.
However, the output differs between `traceFormat` and that of the `consoleFormat` and `messageFormat`.
The TBASIC format adds consistency to `consoleFormat`, `messageFormat`, and `traceFormat` to match the BASIC option for `traceFormat`.
The TBASIC format also acts as an alias for the BASIC option.

The new options can be used in the `bootstrap.properties` file:

----
com.ibm.ws.logging.message.format=tbasic
com.ibm.ws.logging.console.format=tbasic
com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.format=tbasic
----

You can specify the TBASIC log format in your `bootstrap.properties` file, as shown in the following example:

----
WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT=TBASIC
WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT=TBASIC
----

[#settings]
== Configuration settings by source

The following table shows the equivalent `server.xml` file, `bootstrap.properties` file, and environment variable configurations along with brief descriptions. For more information, see the xref:reference:config/logging.adoc[logging element].

.Logging configuration settings
[%header,cols="6,9,9,9"]
|===
| Server XML Attribute|bootstrap property|Env var|Description

|hideMessage
|com.ibm.ws.logging.hideMessage
|
|You can use this setting to configure the messages keys that you want to hide from the `console.log` and `messages.log` files. When the messages are hidden, they are redirected to the `trace.log` file.

|jsonFieldMappings
|com.ibm.ws.logging.json.field.mappings
|WLP_LOGGING_JSON_FIELD_MAPPINGS
|When logs are in JSON format, use this setting to replace default field names with new field names or to omit fields from the logs. For more information, see <<#names,Configurable JSON field names>>


|logDirectory
|com.ibm.ws.logging.log.directory
|LOG_DIR
|You can use this setting to set a directory for all log files, excluding the `console.log` file, but including FFDC. The default is `WLP_OUTPUT_DIR/serverName/logs`. It is not recommended to set the `logDirectory` in the `server.xml` file since it can result in some log data being written to the default location prior to when the `server.xml` file is read.

|consoleFormat
|com.ibm.ws.logging.console.format
|WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT
|This setting specifies the required format for the console. Valid values are `dev`, `simple`, or `json` format. By default, `consoleFormat` is set to `dev`.

|consoleLogLevel
|com.ibm.ws.logging.console.log.level
|WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL
|This setting controls the granularity of messages that go to the console. The valid values are INFO, AUDIT, WARNING, ERROR, and OFF. The default is AUDIT. If using with the Eclipse developer tools this must be set to the default.

|consoleSource
|com.ibm.ws.logging.console.source
|WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE
|This setting specifies a comma-separated list of sources that route to the console. It applies only when the console format is set to `json`. The valid values are `message`, `trace`, `accessLog`, `ffdc`, and `audit`. By default, `consoleSource` is set to `message`. To use the `audit` source, enable the Liberty feature:audit-1.0[] feature. To use the `accessLog` source you need to have configured config:httpAccessLogging[].

|copySystemStreams
|com.ibm.ws.logging.copy.system.streams
|
|If this setting is set to `true`, messages that are written to the System.out and System.err streams are copied to process `stdout` and `stderr` streams and so appear in the `console.log` file. If this setting is set to `false`, those messages are written to configured logs such as the `messages.log` file or `trace.log` file, but they are not copied to `stdout` and `stderr` and do not appear in `console.log`. The default value is true.

|
|com.ibm.ws.logging.newLogsOnStart
|
|If this setting is set to true when Open Liberty starts, any existing `messages.log` or `trace.log` files are rolled over and logging writes to a new `messages.log` or `trace.log` file. If this setting is set to false, `messages.log` or `trace.log` files only refresh when they hit the size that is specified by the `maxFileSize` attribute. The default value is `true`. This setting cannot be provided using the `logging` element in the `server.xml` file because it is only processed during server bootstrap.

|isoDateFormat
|com.ibm.ws.logging.isoDateFormat
|
|This setting specifies whether to use ISO-8601 formatted dates in log files. The default value is false.

If this setting is set to true, the ISO-8601 format is used in the `messages.log` file, the `trace.log` file, and the FFDC logs. The format is `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`.

If you specify a value of `false`, the date and time are formatted according to the default locale set in the system. If the default locale is not found, the format is `dd/MMM/yyyy HH:mm:ss:SSS z`.

|maxFiles
|com.ibm.ws.logging.max.files
|
|This setting specifies how many of each of the logs files are kept. This setting also applies to the number of exception summary logs for FFDC. So if this number is `10`, you might have 10 message logs, 10 trace logs, and 10 exception summaries in the `ffdc/` directory. By default, the value is `2`. The console log does not roll so this setting does not apply to the `console.log` file.

|maxFileSize
|com.ibm.ws.logging.max.file.size
|
|This setting specifies the  maximum size (in MB) that a log file can reach before it is rolled. Setting the value to `0` disables log rolling. The default value is `20`. The `console.log` does not roll so this setting does not apply.

|messageFileName
|com.ibm.ws.logging.message.file.name
|
|This setting specifies the name of the message log file. The message log file has a default name of `messages.log`. This file always exists, and contains INFO and other (AUDIT, WARNING, ERROR, FAILURE) messages in addition to the `System.out` and `System.err` streams . This log also contains time stamps and the issuing thread ID. If the log file is rolled over, the names of earlier log files have the format `messages_timestamp.log`

|messageFormat
|com.ibm.ws.logging.message.format
|WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_FORMAT
|This setting specifies the required format for the `messages.log` file. Valid values are `simple` or `json` format. By default, `messageFormat` is set to `simple`.

|messageSource
|com.ibm.ws.logging.message.source
|WLP_LOGGING_MESSAGE_SOURCE
|This setting specifies a list of comma-separated sources that route to the `messages.log` file. This setting applies only when the message format is set to `json``. The valid values are `message`, `trace`, `accessLog`, `ffdc`, and `audit`. By default, `messageSource` is set to `message`. To use the `audit` source, enable the Liberty feature:audit-1.0[] feature. To use the `accessLog` source you need to have configured config:httpAccessLogging[].

|suppressSensitiveTrace
|
|
|This attribute, when set to `true`, prevents potentially sensitive information from being exposed in log and trace files. The server trace can expose sensitive data when it traces untyped data, such as bytes received over a network connection. The default value is `false`.

|traceFileName
|com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.file.name
|
|This setting specifies the name of the trace log file. The `trace.log` file is created only if additional or detailed trace is enabled. `stdout` is recognized as a special value, and causes trace to be directed to the original standard out stream.

|traceFormat
|com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.format
|
|This setting controls the format of the trace log. The default format for Liberty is `ENHANCED`. You can also use `BASIC` and `ADVANCED` formats.

|traceSpecification
|com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.specification
|
|This setting is used to selectively enable trace. The log detail level specification is in the following format:

`component = level`

The component specifies what log sources the level is set for. A component can be a logger name, trace group, or class name. The level specifies what level of trace to output for that component by using one of the following levels:

`off`, `fatal`, `severe`, `warning`, `audit`, `info`, `config`, `detail`, `fine`, `finer`, `finest`, `all`.

You can provide multiple log detail level specifications that are separated by colons.

An asterisk pass:[*] acts as a wildcard to match multiple components based on a prefix. For example:

- `pass:[*]` Specifies all traceable code that is running in the application server, including the product system code and customer code.

- `com.ibm.ws.pass:[*]` Specifies all classes with the package name beginning with com.ibm.ws.

- `com.ibm.ws.classloading.AppClassLoader` Specifies the AppClassLoader class only.

|appsWriteJson
|com.ibm.ws.logging.apps.write.json
|WLP_LOGGING_APPS_WRITE_JSON
|When the message log or console is in JSON format, this setting allows applications to write JSON-formatted messages to those destinations, without modification.

|jsonAccessLogFields
|com.ibm.ws.json.access.log.fields
|WLP_LOGGING_JSON_ACCESS_LOG_FIELDS
|When logs are in JSON format, you can use this setting to replace the default HTTP access log JSON fields with fields that are specified by the `logFormat` attribute of the `accesLogging` element.
