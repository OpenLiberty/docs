Securing your application from vulnerabilities is important to prevent unauthorized access to your application.
Make sure that your application is secure earlier, rather than later during development, and not overlook the important security steps only to revisit them later.

If a user wants to access your application, you need to verify their identity to make sure they are who they claim to be.
It is also important to protect the user credentials from being displayed.
xref:authentication.adoc[Authentication] verifies the identity of the user and give user access to the system.
To verify user identity, you can create a basic registry, which is a text-based xref:user-registries-application-security.adoc#_basic_user_registries_for_application_development[user registry], directly in the applications `server.xml` file, or a quickstart registry if you need a single user for a start.
You can also use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which makes traffic confidential and secure by using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
You can also xref:password-encryption.adoc[encrypt] the password. The encryption ensures that the password is not stored in plain text in your application.

For production, you can use xref:single-sign-on.adoc[Single sign-on] (SSO), for authentication.
For example, with Open ID Connect (OIDC), a user can log in to the application without creating a separate account.
If a user registry exists, then you can set up authentication with xref: single-sign-on.adoc#_saml[Security Assertion Markup Language] (SAML).
For Windows Active Directory, you can use xref: single-sign-on.adoc#_spnego[Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation] (SPNEGO) for authentication.
If you don't need to use an existing user registry, you can use a social media provider, for example, the xref:single-sign-on.adoc#_social_media_login[Social Media Login] feature so that the social media platform manages the user registry and login procedure for you.
For more information on using the Social Media Login feature, see, link:/guides/social-media-login.html[Social media login] guide.

You can further authorize access to the users of your application based on user groups and roles.
xref:authorization.adoc[Authorization] filters user access based on the role of the user, and the groups that the user belongs to.
During authorization, Open Liberty checks the roles that are specified for the user against the user roles that are defined for the application resources.
For example, during authentication, the user’s request is routed to a single sign-on (SSO) identity provider, which confirms the user’s identity and roles.
The identity provider then sends the authentication data back to the application, where it is used to authorize user access to protected resources.
The user is granted access to any resources that match their role.

Finally, before production, make sure that you work through the advice for xref:security-hardening.adoc[hardening] your application.
Hardening enhances your system security against potential threats and risks in production.
Harden your Open Liberty server configuration, application configuration, and network to reduce vulnerabilities and prevent security intrusions.
