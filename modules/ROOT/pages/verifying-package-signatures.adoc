= Verifying Open Liberty release package signatures

You can use signature files and the corresponding public key to verify the authenticity and integrity of an Open Liberty release package. Signature files are produced for every package of an Open Liberty release.

The Open Liberty project uses its private key to digitally sign each Open Liberty release. You can use the Open Liberty public key to check the signature, verify that the package was released by Open Liberty, and that it was not modified since its release.

You can verify a release package either locally, by using the `openssl` command and a `.sig` file, or on Maven Central, by using the `gpg` command. When you verify the release locally, you can also verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key by using a certificate (`.cer`) file.

== Verifying Open Liberty release package signatures with OpenSSL

To verify an Open Liberty release package locally, you must first download an Open Liberty `.zip` release package, the corresponding `.sig` file, and a `.cer` file, which includes the Open Liberty public key. After you extract the Open Liberty public key from the `.cer` file, you can run the `openssl` command to verify the package signature. Optionally, you can verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key before you extract it from the `.cer` file.

In the following examples, replace the `<OpenLiberty_certificate>` and `<Open_Liberty_release_package>` variables with the public key (`.cer`), signature (`.sig`), and release package (`.zip`) files that you are using to verify a release package.

1. Go to the **Download package** section of the Open Liberty https://www.openliberty.io/start/[Get Started page] and download an Open Liberty `.zip` release package and the corresponding `.sig` and `.cer` files.

2. Verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key.
+
The Open Liberty public key is embedded in the `.cer` file. Before you extract the Open Liberty public key, you can verify that it was produced by Open Liberty. Run the following https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-dgst.html[openssl command] from the directory that contains the `.cer` file:
+
[source,sh]
----
openssl x509 -text -in <OpenLiberty_certificate>.pem.cer
----
+
If the verification is successful, the console displays output that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,sh]
----

-----END CERTIFICATE-----

3. Extract the public key from the `.cer` file as a `.pem` file.
+
The Open Liberty public key is embedded in the `.cer` file. To extract the key to a separate `.pem` file, run the following command from the directory that contains the `.cer` file:
+
[source,sh]
----
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in <OpenLiberty_certificate>.pem.cer -pubkey -noout > <OpenLiberty_certificate>.pem
----
+
You can now use this `.pem` file to verify the release package.

4. Verify the authenticity and integrity of the release package.
+
Navigate to the directory that contains the release archive `.zip` file, the corresponding `.sig` file, and the `.pem` file that you extracted in the previous step. Run the following command to verify the release package.
+
[source,sh]
----
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify <OpenLiberty_certificate>.pem -signature <Open_Liberty_release_package>.zip.sig <Open_Liberty_release_package>.zip
----

=== Results
If the verification succeeds, the command produces the following console output.

[source,sh]
----
Verified OK
----

== Verify Open Liberty package signatures on Maven Central

To verify Open Liberty packages on Maven Central, you must download `openliberty-runtime-\*.zip` and `openliberty-runtime-*.zip.asc` files for your chosen release from Maven Central. You must also download the Open Liberty public key to your local machine and set trust level for the key owner by using https://gnupg.org[the gpg or gpg2 command]. You can then use this key to verify the Open Liberty release package signature.

1. Go to the link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/openliberty/openliberty-runtime[openliberty-runtime repository on Maven Central] and click the release version that you want to verify, for example, `24.0.0.1`.

2. Download the `openliberty-runtime-\*.zip` and `openliberty-runtime-*.zip.asc` files that correspond to the release you want to verify, for example `openliberty-runtime-24.0.0.1.zip` and `openliberty-runtime-24.0.0.1.zip.asc`. Make sure to save the `.asc` file from your browser as an `.asc` file.

3. Run the following command to download the Open Liberty public key file. The key ID value for the Open Liberty public key is `9E68CA00`.
+
[source,sh]
----
gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 9E68CA00
----

4. Run the `gpg2 --edit-key` command to https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html[set the trust for the key owner] to 5.
+
The following examples show the `gpg2 --edit-key` command and the console output that it generates.
+
[source,sh]
----
gpg2 --edit-key "International Business Machines Corporation <psirt@us.ibm.com>"

+
When you run the `gpg2 --edit-key` command, the console displays information about the key owner, followed by an internal command prompt.
At this prompt, enter the `trust` command, as shown in the following example.
+
[source,sh]
----

+
You are then prompted to select a level of trust. Enter `5` and confirm your choice by entering `y`.
+
[source,sh]
----
Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

1 = I don't know or won't say
2 = I do NOT trust
3 = I trust marginally
4 = I trust fully
5 = I trust ultimately
m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
----

5. Verify the release package by running the `gpg2 --verify` command from the directory that contains the Open Liberty public key and the `.zip` and `.asc` release package files that you downloaded from Maven central.
+
The following example uses the `openliberty-runtime-24.0.0.1.zip.asc` file to verify the 24.0.0.1 release package signature. Replace this value with the release package that you want to validate.
+
[source,sh]
----
gpg2 --verify openliberty-runtime-24.0.0.1.zip.asc
----

=== Results

If the verification succeeds, the command produces console output that is similar to the following example:

[source,sh]
----
