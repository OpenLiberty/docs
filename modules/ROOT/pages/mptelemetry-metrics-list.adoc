= MicroProfile Telemetry metrics reference list

The MicroProfile Telemetry metrics reference table lists and describes all the metrics that are available for Open Liberty when you enable the MicroProfile Telemetry feature 2.0 or later.
Use metric data to effectively monitor the status of your microservice systems.

You can obtain metrics from applications, the Open Liberty runtime, and the Java virtual machine (JVM). They can be gathered and stored in database tools, such as link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus], and displayed on dashboards, such as link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana].

When you enable the feature:mpTelemetry-2.0[display=MicroProfile Telemetry] feature version 2.0 and later, you can manage your logs, metrics, and traces in a standardized way with the OpenTelemetry protocol. For more information, see xref:microprofile-telemetry[Enable observability with MicroProfile Telemetry].


== Filter metrics to gather only the data you need
By default, all monitoring components are enabled. If your server is collecting more metrics data than you need, you can improve the server performance by collecting only those metrics that you intend to use. To configure only a subset of metrics to be reported, specify the components that you want to monitor in the `filter` attribute for the `monitor` configuration element in your `server.xml` file. You can identify the relevant monitoring component for each metric by referencing the **Monitoring component** column of the metrics reference tables.

To enable only the monitoring components that are used by MicroProfile Telemetry, add the following code to your `server.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter="ConnectionPool,ThreadPool,RequestTiming,Session,HTTP"/>
----

To disable all metrics but the `Session` metrics, add the following code to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter="Session"/>
----

To disable all monitoring components, add the following code to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter=" "/>
----


== MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 and later metrics reference

When the MicroProfile Telemetry feature 2.0 and later is enabled, Open Liberty can send metric data to compatible OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) receivers. For more information, see xref:microprofile-telemetry[Enable observability with MicroProfile Telemetry].

The table lists the metric types, descriptions and attributes that are available for Open Liberty. Where applicable, the associated monitoring component that you can use to filter the metric is also included.
The **Features required** column of the table includes the feature or features that must be enabled to obtain that metric data.
The **Version introduced** column specifies the minimum version of the feature that you must enable to collect the metric.
