= Asynchronous input and output

With asynchronous read and asynchronous write, inbound data can be processed more quickly and outbound responses can be written more quickly than with synchronous read and synchronous write.
By following the requirements for implementing asynchronous read and asynchronous write, you can benefit your Open Liberty server, particularly if large amounts of post data or response data must be processed.

== Asynchronous read
Consider a scenario where a client request includes two packets of data that are sent 1 second apart by the client.
In synchronous read, the application must occupy a thread for the entire time it takes to receive the data sent by the client.
The thread starts when the first packet is received and then waits for 1 second to receive the second packet, so the thread is occupied for 1 second.
In a server with 10 threads, you can process 10 inbound requests per second.

In asynchronous read, the application relinquishes the thread after the first packet is received from the client and is redispatched when the second packet arrives.
Assume that it takes 0.1 seconds to process each inbound packet, so the inbound request occupies a thread for 0.2 seconds.
In this case, the same server with 10 threads can process 50 inbound requests per second.
Ideally, the throughput of your application server isn't affected by the rate at which data is received from a client.
If throughput is affected by the rate at which data is received, it takes only a few bad clients and throughput drops.
With asynchronous read, you remove this variable so you have better, more consistent throughput.

== Asynchronous read sample code
The following examples demonstrate the key requirements for implementing asynchronous read in your code.


=== Register a ReadListener
To take advantage of asynchronous read, your application must provide a `ReadListener` implementation that is called when inbound data is received.
The `ReadListener` implementation reads the data as it's received and starts the business logic after all data is read.
The `ReadListener` implementation is registered by a servlet, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException, ServletException {

    // Asynchronous I/O requires an asynchronous servlet.
    req.startAsync();

    // Register the ReadListener object with the ServletInputStream object.
    req.getInputStream().setReadListener(new SampleReadListener(req, res));

    // The servlet returns, which relinquishes the thread.
}
----

This example shows a `doPost` method that includes the two steps that are required by a servlet to perform asynchronous read.
The implementation in the example is for the `doPost` method because a `ReadListener` implementation is useful only when a request includes post data.
The first step starts asynchronous processing, and the second step registers a `ReadListener` object with the `ServletInputStream` object for the request.
After these steps are complete, the servlet returns to relinquish the thread.
If you need the servlet to perform extra steps, the servlet must perform these extra steps before the `ReadListener` object is set.
Otherwise, the servlet and the `ReadListener` object compete to process.

=== Read and store inbound data
The `ReadListener` object implements three methods, `onDataAvailable`, `onAllDataRead`, and `onError`.
The `onDataAvailable` method reads and optionally stores the inbound data.
In the following example, after the inbound data is read, the inbound data is stored for processing:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onDataAvailable() throws IOException {

    byte postData[] = new byte[1024];
    int postDataLen;

    ServletInputStream inStream = _req.getInputStream();

    // The isReady method must be checked before each read. If it returns false, all
    // currently available data was read, so the thread should be relinquished.
    // If the isFinished method returns true, all data was read.
    while (inStream.isReady() && !inStream.isFinished()) {

        // Only one read of data is allowed inside the loop.
        postDataLen = inStream.read(postData);

        // Save the input data for processing later.
        if (postDataLen > 0)
            outData.add(new String(postData, 0, postDataLen));
    }
}
----

The while loop in this example implements two key requirements:

* The `isReady` method is called before every read of data.
A second read of data occurs after the `isReady` method is called.
This second read of data is effectively a synchronous read and results in an `IllegalStateException` exception.
* The `onDataAvailable` method doesn't return unless the `isReady` method returns false or all data is read.
If the `onDataAvailable` method returns when the `isReady` method returns true and more data must be read, the container doesn't call the `onDataAvailable` method again until the `isReady` method is called and returns false.
If the `onDataAvailable` method returned when the call to the `isReady` method returned true and all of the data wasn't read, your application must call the `onDataAvailable` method again to restart the read.

=== Process inbound data
In the next example, the inbound data is saved for later processing.
The `onAllDataRead` method is called by the container after all inbound data is read.
The `onAllDataRead` method performs the business logic based on the inbound data:

[#readlistener-onalldataread]
[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onAllDataRead() throws IOException {

    // Process the inbound data.
    for (String outDataString : outData) {
        _res.getOutputStream().print(outDataString);
    }

    // Indicate that the asynchronous request is complete.
    _req.getAsyncContext().complete();
}
----

In this simple example, the data is written back to the client.
After all the data is written, the asynchronous request is completed by the `AsyncContext.complete` method.

=== Log any errors
The `onError` method is called if any error occurs when the inbound data is being processed.
If this method is called, it's the last method called on the `ReadListener` object.
In this example, the application returns an error message to the client and then completes the asynchronous request:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onError(Throwable arg0) {

    try {
        _res.getOutputStream().println("Exception when processing inbound data : " + arg0);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Log an error.
    }

    // Indicate that the request is complete.
    _asyncContext.complete();
}
----

== Asynchronous write
Asynchronous write is similar to asynchronous read, but asynchronous write is used for sending responses to the client.
Assume that a response is sent in two packets.
The first packet is sent to the client immediately, but the second packet can be sent only after the client acknowledges that the first packet was received.
In synchronous write, a thread is occupied while it waits for the acknowledgment of the client.
But in asynchronous write, a thread isn't occupied while it waits for the acknowledgment of the client.
As a result, throughput can be increased because a thread isn't held to wait for the client to acknowledge receipt of data.
Asynchronous write can be less useful than asynchronous read because your servlet and HTTP implementation might effectively perform the work of asynchronous writing.
Your application can write as much as it needs, and the underlying implementation might buffer the response and send it asynchronously.

== Asynchronous write sample code
The following examples demonstrate the key requirements for implementing asynchronous write in your code.
In most applications, asynchronous read and asynchronous write are combined.
In the previous asynchronous example code, <<readlistener-onalldataread,the ReadListener.onAllDataRead method>> registers the `WriteListener` object and provides the response data to the `WriteListener` object on its constructor.

=== Register a WriteListener
To use asynchronous write, your application must provide a `WriteListener` implementation, which is called when response data can be sent without blocking.
The `WriteListener` implementation is registered by a servlet, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException, ServletException {

    // Asynchronous I/O requires an asynchronous servlet.
    req.startAsync();

    // Register the WriteListener object with the ServletOuputStream object.
    res.getOutputStream().setWriteListener(new SampleWriteListener(req, res, 200));

    // The servlet returns, which relinquishes the thread.
}
----

This example shows a `service` method that includes the two steps that are required to perform asynchronous write.
In this example, the `service` method is acceptable because a `WriteListener` object can be used for any inbound method, for example, the `doPost` method.
The first step starts asynchronous processing, and the second step registers a `WriteListener` object with the `ServletOutputStream` object for the request.
After these steps are complete, the servlet returns to relinquish the thread.
If you need the servlet to perform extra steps, the servlet must perform these extra steps before the `WriteListener` object is set.
Otherwise, the servlet and the `WriteListener` object compete to process.

=== Write an outbound response
The `WriteListener` object implements two methods, `onWritePossible` and `onError`.
The `onWritePossible` method is responsible for writing outbound responses:

[source,java]
----
public void onWritePossible() throws IOException {

    ServletOutputStream outStream = _res.getOutputStream();

    // Write each line of data, checking the isReady method before each write.
    while (outStream.isReady() && _numWritesRemaining > 0) {
        _numWritesDone++;
        _numWritesRemaining--;
        outStream.println(_asyncEvents + "." + _numWritesDone + _outData);
    }

    if (_numWritesRemaining == 0) {
        // If all data was written, complete the asynchronous request.
        _req.getAsyncContext().complete();
    } else {
        // The isReady method returned false before all data was written.
        _asyncEvents++;
    }
}
----

The `onWritePossible` method implements three key requirements:

* The `isReady` method is called before every write of data.
A second write of data occurs after the `isReady` method is called.
This second write of data is effectively a synchronous write and results in an `IllegalStateException` exception.
* The `onWritePossible` method doesn't return unless the `isReady` method returns false or all data is written.
If the `onWritePossible` method returns when the `isReady` method returns true and more data must be written, the container doesn't call the `onWritePossible` method again until the `isReady` method is called and returns false.
One effect of this requirement is that all of the response data must be available before the `WriteListener` object is registered.
If all of the response data isn't available, the `onWritePossible` method must return when the `isReady` method is true even though some response data wasn't written.
* The `AsyncContext.complete` method is called to end the asynchronous request after all data is written.
An equivalent to the `onAllDataRead` method of the `ReadListener` object doesn't exist for the `WriteListener` object because only your application knows when all response data is written.

The `onError` method is called if any error occurs when the response data is being processed.
If this method is called, it's the last method called on the `WriteListener` object.
In this case, the application generates an error log and then completes the asynchronous request.
