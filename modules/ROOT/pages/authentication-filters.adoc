= Authentication filters

An authentication filter specifies how a request for application resources is authenticated. You can set authentication filters to secure different types of HTTP servlet requests with different authentication mechanisms, such as SPNEGO or JSON Web Tokens.

Authentication mechanisms in Open Liberty are managed by the server configuration. In an application where different kinds of protected resources require different authentication mechanisms, authentication filters can control how authentication is managed for each resource. You can configure authentication filters in your `server.xml` file to look for different characteristics of a request, such as URL pattern, IP address, domain name, browser type, and more.

For example, in a banking application, resources for customers might be accessible through social media login while resources for administrators are secured by SPNEGO. In that case, you can configure an authentication filter to secure requests that contain the `/mywebapp` URL pattern with social media login. You can set another authentication filter to secure requests that contain the `/EmployeeRoleServlet` URL pattern with SPNEGO.

Open Liberty supports authentication filters for various authentication mechanisms, including xref:reference:feature/mpJwt-1.1.adoc#_specify_login_with_microprofile_jwt_for_a_subset_of_applications_urls_browsers_or_ip_addresses[JSON Web Tokens], xref:reference:feature/spnego-1.0.adoc#_apply_spnego_authentication_to_a_subset_of_http_requests[Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO)], and xref:reference:feature/socialLogin-1.0.adoc#_request_log_in_with_a_social_media_id_for_only_a_subset_of_applications_urls_browsers_or_ip_addresses[Social Media Login].

For example, you can configure an authentication filter for the link:/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login] feature to secure requests from a web application with Google credentials. In the following example, request URLs that contain the `/mywebapp` pattern are authenticated by using Google credentials:
