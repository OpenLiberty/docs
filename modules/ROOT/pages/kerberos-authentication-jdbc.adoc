= Kerberos authentication for JDBC data sources

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol through which a client and server can authenticate one another by communicating with a trusted third-party Key Distribution Center (KDC). You can configure your Open Liberty server to use Kerberos credentials to authenticate to a database that is backed by a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) data source.

Applications that run on an Open Liberty server might need to access protected resources in a database, such as user account information or sales transaction records. In cases where such a database is protected by Kerberos authentication, your Open Liberty server can  supply the necessary credentials to access protected resources and confirm the authenticity of the database.

== Global Kerberos configuration for Open Liberty

Kerberos authentication in Open Liberty builds on the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.security.auth/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html[Kerberos Login Module] and Java Generic Security Service (JGSS) API that are  provided by the JDK.

The optional xref:reference:config/kerberos.adoc[kerberos element] provides configuration options for any Open Liberty features that use Kerberos credentials. If you have any Kerberos-enabled features configured for your server, you can specify this element in your `server.xml` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
</featureManager>

<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

This example shows a Kerberos configuration for the xref:reference:feature/jdbc-4.2.adoc[Java Database Connectivity feature]. Several different features support the `kerberos` element. To determine whether a feature supports this element, see the feature documentation.

The `keytab` and `configFile` attributes are both optional. If you don't specify these attributes, Open Liberty resolves their values according to the following priority:

1. The default locations that are defined by the JDK, such as the `{user.home}/krb5.keytab` file or a location that is specified by JDK-defined system properties
2. The default locations that are defined by the operating system, such as the `/etc/krb5.keytab` file or a location that is specified by operating system-defined environment variables

On the Windows operating system, the default Kerberos configuration file name is `krb5.ini`. On other operating systems, the file name is `krb5.conf`.

== Kerberos configuration for JDBC data sources

To configure Kerberos authentication for JDBC data sources, you must enable the xref:reference:feature/jdbc-4.2.adoc[Java Database Connectivity feature]. For more information about JDBC data source connections, see xref:relational-database-connections-JDBC.adoc#_data_source_configuration[Data source configuration].
After the Kerberos global configuration is defined, a Kerberos principal can be configured on an `authData` element in the `server.xml` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<authData id="myKerberosAuth" krb5Principal="krbUser" krb5TicketCache="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5cc_krbUser"/>

<library id="db2DriverLib">
  <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/db2"/>
</library>

<dataSource jndiName="jdbc/krb/basic" containerAuthDataRef="myKerberosAuth">
  <jdbcDriver libraryRef="${server.config.dir}/db2DriverLib"/>
  <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="${DB2_DBNAME}" serverName="${DB2_HOSTNAME}" portNumber="${DB2_PORT}"/>
</dataSource>
----

The `krb5TicketCache` attribute is optional. If this attribute isn't specified, Open Liberty checks the default Kerberos credential cache location of the JDK or the operating system.
The `containerAuthDataRef` attribute references the `authData` element to authenticate the database connection.

To enable portability of the configuration, the values for the `databaseName`, `serverName`, and `portNumber` properties are supplied by variables. For more information, see xref:reference:config/server-configuration-overview.adoc#variable-substitution[Variable substitution precedence].

Optionally, you can specify the `recoveryAuthDataRef` attribute on the `dataSource` element to use alternative values for the  `krb5Principal` and `krb5TicketCache` attributes for authentication during XA recovery. If the `recoveryAuthDataRef` attribute isn't specified, the `authData` element that is referenced by the `containerAuthDataRef` attribute is used for authentication during XA recovery.

https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/JDBC-Thin-features.html#GUID-003FC8A9-9CD7-41C4-AD73-BE6F5D13D1DB[The Oracle JDBC thin driver] supports only the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK Kerberos implementations. If you are using the Oracle JDBC thin driver with the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/welcome/welcome_javasdk_version.html[IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8], you cannot authenticate with Kerberos.

== Compatibility with SPNEGO authentication

Open Liberty also supports xref:configuring-spnego-authentication.adoc[SPNEGO authentication] for web authentication and JDBC data source authentication. The `kerberos` element is optional, but can be used to customize `keytab` file and `configFile` file locations that are used for SPNEGO authentication.

You aren't required to configure the `containerAuthDataRef` or `recoveryAuthDataRef` attributes on your `datasource` element to use SPNEGO authentication with a JDBC data source. However, if you use an XA-capable data source with SPNEGO authentication, you must configure a non-SPNEGO `recoveryAuthDataRef` value on the data source because SPNEGO authentication cannot be used for automatic XA recovery.

For example, the following configuration enables a JDBC data source to use SPNEGO authentication to an IBM Db2 data source:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
  <feature>spnego-1.0</feature>
  <feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<spnego servicePrincipalNames="HTTP/my.spnego.server.com" authFilterRef="myAuthFilter"/>
<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
  <requestUrl urlPattern="/MySpnegoServlet" matchType="contains"/>
</authFilter>

<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>

<library id="db2DriverLib">
  <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/db2"/>
</library>

<dataSource jndiName="jdbc/spnegoAuth">
  <jdbcDriver libraryRef="db2DriverLib"/>
  <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="${DB2_DBNAME}" serverName="${DB2_HOSTNAME}" portNumber="${DB2_PORT}"/>
</dataSource>
