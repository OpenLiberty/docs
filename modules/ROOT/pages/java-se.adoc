= Java SE support

Open Liberty requires a Java SE runtime.
It can run by using either a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) distribution.

Open Liberty runs on any of the Java SE versions that are listed in the *Java SE version* column of the <<#supported,Supported Java Releases>> table.
Always run Open Liberty on the most recent service release of your chosen Java version.
A new version of Java SE is released every six months.
Unless the prior version is designated as a Long Term Support (LTS) release, it no longer receives service updates for function and security after the new version is released.
Whenever a non-LTS release is replaced by the next version, the Open Liberty project no longer validates the runtime against the older version.

== Choosing a JVM

Regardless of which Java SE Version you use, two Java virtual machine (JVM) implementations are available: https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[Eclipse OpenJ9] and https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/[HotSpot], each of which is packaged in different Java distributions. These JVMs provide similar throughput performance, but make different tradeoffs for memory footprint and startup.
As a result, Open Liberty recommends using a Java distribution that packages Eclipse OpenJ9 because it has a faster start time and uses less memory.
The main Java distribution that uses Eclipse OpenJ9 is https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/[IBM Semeru].
IBM Semeru provides uncertified Open Edition releases under a GPLv2 license with classpath exception, and Certified Edition releases under an IBM license.

== Migration tools

In addition to the Java migration guides, tools are available that can provide migration advice that is targeted to your applications.
The https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6250913[Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries] can scan a JAR, WAR or EAR file and provide advice on migrating to new Java SE versions.
After you https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6250913[download] and install the tool, you can run it with the following command:

```
java -jar binaryAppScanner.jar myapp.war --analyze --sourceJava=ibm8 --targetJava=java11
```

Plug-ins that run a similar analysis on your application are available from Eclipse in the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm-websphere-application-server-migration-toolkit-was-liberty[Eclipse marketplace].
