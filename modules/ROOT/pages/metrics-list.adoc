= Metrics reference information

The metrics reference list includes all the metrics that are available for Open Liberty.
Use metric data to effectively monitor the status of your microservice systems.

You can obtain metrics from applications, the Open Liberty runtime, and the Java virtual machine (JVM).
They can be gathered and stored in database tools, such as https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus], and displayed on dashboards, such as https://grafana.com/[Grafana].
For more information about building observability into your applications, see xref:microservice-observability-metrics.adoc[Microservice observability with metrics].

== Base and vendor metrics
When the feature:mpMetrics[display="MicroProfile metrics"] feature is enabled, a set of base metrics is always reported. You can augment this set of metrics by collecting vendor metrics, which are available from different monitoring components within your Open Liberty server. When you enable both the feature:monitor[display="Performance Monitoring"] and the MicroProfile metrics features, you enable the reporting of vendor metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint. The Performance Monitoring feature retrieves the statistical data from all available monitoring components. The `REST` base metrics that were introduced in MicroProfile Metrics 2.3 also rely on the Performance Monitoring feature. Before MicroProfile Metrics 2.3, the Performance Monitoring feature had to be explicitly configured. In MicroProfile Metrics 2.3, and later, the Performance Monitoring feature is automatically enabled by MicroProfile Metrics during startup.

== Filter metrics to gather only the data you need
By default, all monitoring components are enabled. If your server is collecting more metrics data than you need, you can improve the server performance by collecting only those vendor metrics that you intend to use. To configure only a subset of vendor metrics to be reported, specify the components that you want to monitor in the `filter` attribute for the `monitor` configuration element in your `server.xml` file. You can identify the relevant monitoring component for each vendor metric by referencing the **Monitoring component** column of the metrics reference tables.

To enable only the monitoring components that are used by MicroProfile Metrics, add the following code to your `server.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter="ConnectionPool,ThreadPool,RequestTiming,Session,WebContainer,REST,GrpcClient,GrpcServer"/>
----

To disable all vendor metrics, but to keep the `REST` base metrics configure the `server.xml`, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter="REST"/>
----

To disable all monitoring components, add the following code to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<monitor  filter=" "/>
----

== Metrics reference tables

The following two tables list the available metrics when you use <<#metrics-table-mp-metrics-5, MicroProfile Metrics 5.0>> or <<#metrics-table,MicroProfile Metrics 4.0 (or earlier versions)>>.
In both tables, the Prometheus metric names are listed after each metric.
The tables also lists the metric types, metric units, and descriptions of all metrics that are available for Open Liberty. For the vendor metrics, the associated monitoring component that you can use to filter the metric is also included.
The **Features required** column of the table includes the feature or features that must be enabled to obtain that metric data.
The **Version introduced** column specifies the minimum version of the feature that you must enable to collect the metric.

=== Units in the metrics reference tables

For both tables, metric units are included along with both the metric names and Prometheus names. In earlier releases, these units can differ because the Prometheus exporter scales metrics to a base unit.
For example, while the `ft.<name>.bulkhead.executionDuration` metric is recorded internally in nanoseconds, the Prometheus output is in seconds. +
{empty} +
In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the unit associated to the metric is what is reflected in the Prometheus output. There is no scaling.

If no unit is listed next to the metric name, then no units are associated with that metric.

=== Differences between the MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 and earlier versions

A separate table for for MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 is included because of changes in the release which affect the formatting of the Prometheus name, base metrics, and the metric types. These changes are reflected in the <<#metrics-table-mp-metrics-5, MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 table>>.

Metric registry scope::
In previous releases, the metric registry scope that a metric was associated with was indicated by a prefix of `base_` or `vendor_` in the Prometheus formatted name. In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, this information is displayed with an `mp_scope` tag, for example, `{mp_scope="base"}`.

REST.Request metric::
In previous releases of MicroProfile Metrics, the `REST.Request` metric was instrumented with a `SimpleTimer` metric type. In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 the `SimpleTimer` metric type is no longer available and the metric is instrumented with a `Timer` metric type.

Histogram metric::
In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, metrics that are instrumented with a `Histogram` metric type have fewer formatted outputs than in previous releases, due to the the removal of the `min`, `mean` and `stddev` values. Furthermore, the formatting of the Prometheus output has changed. The suffix that defines the `Histogram` value trails after the unit suffix. For example, `bulkhead_waitingDuration_max_seconds` becomes `bulkhead_waitingDuration_seconds_max`.
