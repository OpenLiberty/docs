= Code instrumentation for MicroProfile Telemetry tracing

After you enable MicroProfile Telemetry and configure a trace server, you can instrument tracing in your application code. You can instrument your code automatically, manually, or by using the Java agent.

* <<#auto, Automatic instrumentation>>, which automatically traces your JAX-RS or RESTful web services.
* <<#manual, Manual instrumentation>>, which enables you to start and end telemetry spans manually for applications that are not JAX-RS or RESTful web services.
* <<#agent, Agent instrumentation>>, which automatically adds telemetry to popular open source libraries. However, agent instrumentation also imposes certain <<#limit, limitations>>.

[#auto]
== Automatic instrumentation

With automatic instrumentation, you can observe traces without modifying the source code in your applications. All that you need to do is configure runtime as described in xref:microprofile-telemetry.adoc#traces[Configuring Open Liberty to use MicroProfile Telemetry to collect traces]. However, automatic instrumentation is available only for JAX-RS and Jakarta RESTful web service applications.

In Open Liberty version 23.0.0.11 and later, spans are automatically generated for incoming HTTP requests, including static files, servlets, and JSPs.

[#manual]
== Manual instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation is available only for JAX-RS and Jakarta RESTful web service applications. To create spans for other operations, such as database calls, you can add manual instrumentation to the source code for those operations by using the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/1.39.0/io/opentelemetry/api/trace/package-summary.html[OpenTelemetry API].

However, before you manually instrument your code, you must enable MicroProfile Telemetry in your development environment by editing your runtime configuration. You must also add the OpenTelemetry API and annotations as a dependency on your build path. For more information, see xref:prepare-mptelemetry.adoc[Prepare your development environment for MicroProfile Telemetry].

After you complete those prerequisites, you're ready to instrument your code. The following examples show configuration options with the OpenTelemetry API.

- Add extra information, such as the user ID, to the current span. Any information that you add to a span is visible when you look at the traces on your trace server.
+
[source,java]
----
private static final AttributeKey<String> USER_ID_ATTR = AttributeKey.stringKey("userId");

@Inject private Span currentSpan;

@GET
public String myMethod() {
    ...
    currentSpan.setAttribute(USER_ID_ATTR, getUserId());
    ...
}
----

- Annotate methods in any Jakarta CDI beans by using the `@WithSpan` annotation. This annotation creates a span and establishes any required relationships with the current trace context. You can annotate method parameters with the `@SpanAttribute` annotation to indicate which method parameters are part of the trace, as shown in the following example.
+
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
class SpanBean {

    @WithSpan("name")
    void spanName() {
       ...
    }

    @WithSpan
    void spanArgs(@SpanAttribute(value = "arg") String arg) {
       ...
    }
}
----
+
However, you cannot create a child span with the `@WithSpan` annotation by calling an internal method in the same class as the parent span. Instead, you can manually create a subspan in the child method, as shown in the next example.

- Create a subspan around a particular operation, such as querying a database. This subspan shows you how long it took and the order in which it occurred relative to other spans.
+
[source,java]
----
@Inject private Tracer tracer;

@GET
public String myMethod() {
    ...
    Span newSpan = tracer.spanBuilder("QueryDatabase").startSpan();
    try (Scope s = newSpan.makeCurrent()) {
        queryDatabase();
    } finally {
        newSpan.end();
    }
    ...
}
----

This example creates a span that is named `QueryDatabase` that can be used to track the execution time and other attributes of the `queryDatabase()` method.

=== Considerations for manual instrumentation

The following important considerations apply to manual instrumentation.

- Call the `.end()` method on any span that you create, otherwise the span is not recorded.
- The current span is used as the parent for any new spans that are created. Therefore, when you create a span, in most cases you also want to make it current. However, you must close the `Scope` instance that is returned by the `Span.makeCurrent()` method. You can close a `Scope` instance by specifying a try-with-resources block, as shown in the previous example for creating a subspan.
- If you set any properties by using environment variables, including those in the `server.env` file, specify the keys in uppercase and replace all punctuation with an underscore. Write values normally.

For more information, see the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual[OpenTelemetry manual instrumentation documentation]. However, remember when you use the MicroProfile Telemetry feature in Open Liberty, you must obtain the `OpenTelemetry` and `Tracer` objects by injecting them, not by creating your own.

[#agent]
== Agent instrumentation
The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation[OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Java] project provides a Java agent JAR file that can be attached to any Java 8+ application. This file dynamically injects bytecode that adds telemetry support to popular open source libraries and frameworks. If you are using any of the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md#libraries--frameworks[supported libraries] in your application, you can use this agent with Open Liberty to instrument them.

To enable the Java agent on your Open Liberty runtime, https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#getting-started[download the latest agent version from OpenTelemetry] and add the following line to your `jvm.options` file.

[subs=+quotes]
----
-javaagent: _path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar_
----

You can configure the agent with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#configuring-the-agent[environment variables and system properties]. You can find a list of supported libraries and frameworks in the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md#libraries--frameworks[OpenTelemetry Java instrumentation documentation].

[#limit]
=== Limitations of agent instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Java agent is a tool that is provided by the OpenTelemetry project. Although it is compatible with Open Liberty, it is a separate project and is subject to the following limitations.

* Configuration works differently when you use the agent. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/[Configuration of the agent is well documented], but the following aspects are different from configuration without the agent:
    ** Configuration is shared between all applications that are deployed to the server.
    ** Configuration properties are only read from system properties and environment variables. They are not read from MicroProfile Config configuration sources.
    ** Because the agent reads its configuration early in the startup process, system properties are not read from the `bootstrap.properties` file. Alternatively, you can set system properties in the `jvm.options` file by using the following syntax: `-Dname=value`
    ** Implementations of https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi/1.39.0/index.html[SPI extensions] within applications are ignored. For more information, see the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/#extensions[agent documentation for providing SPI extensions].
* When you use the agent, it takes over the instrumentation of REST calls and methods that are annotated with the `@WithSpan` annotation. As a result, the created spans might be slightly different.
* The agent is not compatible with https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/base?topic=security-java-2[Java 2 security].
* Open Liberty uses many open source libraries internally. Some of these libraries might be automatically instrumented by the agent.
