= Differences between Jakarta EE 9.1 and 8.0

If you are updating your application from using Jakarta EE 8.0 features to using Jakarta EE 9.1 features, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. Furthermore, the names and version numbers of some of the Open Liberty features that support the Jakarta EE platform are updated for the Jakarta EE 9.1 release.  

For more information about feature name changes in Jakarta EE 9.1, see xref:jakarta-ee9-feature-updates[Jakarta EE 9.1 feature updates].

[#restfulws]
== Differences between Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 and Java Restful Services (JAX-RS)

With the release of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 feature (`restfulWS-3.0`) as part of Jakarta EE 9.1, the underlying Jakarta RESTful Web Services implementation for Open Liberty changed from Apache CXF to RESTEasy. This change results in certain API behavior changes that might require you to update your application code.

Jakarta RESTful Web Services, formerly known as JAX-RS, is a xref:jakarta-ee.adoc[Jakarta EE] platform API. In Open Liberty 21.0.0.12 and later, you can use Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 functions by enabling the feature:restfulWS[display=RESTful Web Services 3.0] feature. The JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 implementations are available through the Java RESTful Services feature (feature:jaxrs-2.0[] and feature:jaxrs-2.1[]). The change in feature name and version reflects the change in API package name prefixes from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`, which is common to all Jakarta EE 9.1 features.
The underlying JAX-RS implementation for Open Liberty also changed from https://cxf.apache.org[Apache CXF] to https://resteasy.github.io[RESTEasy].

If you are updating your server configuration from using the `jaxrs-2.1` feature to the `restfulWS-3.0` feature, certain changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. The following sections detail changes in behavior between the `jaxrs-2.1` and `restfulWS-3.0` features.

- <<#getsingletons,CDI injection with the Application.getSingletons() method>>
- <<#server-side,Server-side asynchronous support>>
- <<#null,Null properties in the jakarta.ws.rs.client API>>
- <<#readentity,Response.readEntity() method return when it is called on an empty entity>>
- <<#headername,HttpHeaders.getRequestHeader(String _headerName_) method return when the specified _headerName_ value does not exist>>
- <<#clientbuilder,Liberty ClientBuilder properties are deprecated>>
- <<#non-cdi,RESTful Web Services parameter non-CDI injection>>
- <<#subresource,Subresource locator methods path names>>
- <<#subclasses,Application subclasses that use CDI injection must be annotated with the @ApplicationPath annotation>>
- <<#bean,CDI and bean-defining annotations>>
- <<#ejb,EJBs that are listed in the getClasses() method for an application subclass>>
- <<#wildcard,Wildcard characters in the @ApplicationPath annotation>>

[#getsingletons]
=== CDI injection with the Application.getSingletons() method

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
You can create an instance of a singleton class and a second instance is generated from CDI to inject into the singleton classes.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
You are required to get an instance of your singleton class from CDI if you want CDI injection into the singleton classes.

[#server-side]
=== Server-side asynchronous support

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
Server-side asynchronous behavior is automatically supported.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
- If the application does not include a `web.xml` file, or if it includes a `web.xml` file that contains only the servlet name, asynchronous behavior is automatically supported.
- If the application includes a `web.xml` file that contains a servlet class or other configuration options, you must specify `<async-supported>true</async-supported>` in the `web.xml` file to get server-side asynchronous support. This requirement does not exist for the `jaxrs-2.1` feature.

[#null]
== Null properties in the jakarta.ws.rs.client API

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
A client property with a null value is maintained as part of the client internal configuration state.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
A client property with a null value is removed from the client internal configuration state.

For example, with the `jaxrs-2.1` feature, the following code returns `containsProp? true`. With the `restfulWS-3.0` feature, it returns `containsProp? false`.

[source,java]
----
ClientBuilder cb = ClientBuilder.newBuilder().property("someProp", null);
System.out.println("containsProp? " + cb.getConfiguration().getProperties().containsKey("someProp"));
----


[#readentity]
=== Response.readEntity() method return when it is called on an empty entity

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
The method returns null.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
The method returns an empty String object.

[#headername]
=== HttpHeaders.getRequestHeader(String _headerName_) method return when the specified _headerName_ value does not exist

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
The method returns an `IllegalStateException` exception.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
The method returns an empty String object.

[#clientbuilder]
== Liberty ClientBuilder properties are deprecated

jaxrs-2.1 properties::
- `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.receive.timeout` property
- `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.connection.timeout` property

restfulWS-3.0 alternatives::
- `ClientBuilder.connectTimeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method
- `ClientBuilder.readTimeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method

[#non-cdi]
=== RESTful Web Services parameter non-CDI injection

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
JAX-RS parameters can be injected into a resource class constructor.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
JAX-RS parameters cannot be injected into a resource class constructor. Resources are CDI beans. Only CDI injection can occur in resource class constructors.

For example, the following code is valid for an application that runs on a server that specifies the `jaxrs-2.1` feature, but not for the  `restfulWS-3.0` feature.

[source,java]
----
@Path("myPath")
public class MyResource {

    private String q1;

    public MyResource(@QueryParam("q1") String q1) {
        this.q1 = q1;
    }

    @GET
    public Response get() {
        doSomethingWith(q1);
        // ...
    }
}
----

For an application that runs on a server that specifies the `restfulWS-3.0` feature, you must rewrite the code similar to the following example.
[source,java]
----
@Path("myPath")
public class MyResource {

    @GET
    public Response get(@QueryParam("q1") String q1) {
        doSomethingWith(q1);
        // ...
    }
}
----

[#subresource]
=== Subresource locator methods path names

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
Subresource locator methods can share the same path as a regular subresource method.

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
Subresource locator methods must not share the same path as a regular subresource method.

For example, the following code is valid for an application that runs on a server that specifies the `jaxrs-2.1` feature, but results in an error with the `restfulWS-3.0` feature.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/root")
public class MyRootResource {
    /*
     * Subresource locator method.
     */
    @Path("subresource")
    public MyObject postSub() {
        return new MyObject();
    }

    public static class MyObject {

        @POST
        public String hello() {
            return "MyObject.hello()";
        }
    }

    /*
     * Subresource method.
     */
    @GET
    @Path("subresource")
    public String getSub() {
        return "MyRootResource.getSub()";
    }
}
----

With the `restfulWS-3.0` feature, this code returns an error that is similar to the following example.

[source,console]
----
[6/16/21, 13:48:03:249 CDT] 00000050 org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy_jaxrs.i18n
----

[#subclasses]
=== Application subclasses that use CDI injection must be annotated with the @ApplicationPath annotation

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
Application subclasses are treated as managed beans and do not require the `@ApplicationPath` annotation for CDI injection.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
Application subclasses are not treated as managed beans and therefore require the `@ApplicationPath` annotation to include CDI injection. Resources are now CDI beans.
Only CDI injection can occur only in resource class constructors.

[#bean]
=== CDI and bean-defining annotations

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
To use CDI in applications, users must explicitly enable CDI with the feature:cdi[display=Contexts and Dependency Injection] feature.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
- RESTful web services always use CDI.
- The `@ApplicationPath`, `@Path`, and `@Provider` annotations are now CDI bean-defining annotations.
- By default, RESTful web services that are annotated with the `@Path` annotation are request-scoped.
- By default, RESTful web services that are annotated with the `@Provider` or `@ApplicationPath` annotations are application-scoped.

[#ejb]
== EJBs that are listed in the getClasses() method for an application subclass

jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
Local interfaces of the EJB bean that are listed in the `getClasses()` method are ignored.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
Local interfaces of the EJB bean that are listed in the `getClasses()` method cause an exception that prevents the application from starting.

[#wildcard]
=== Wildcard characters in the @ApplicationPath annotation
jaxrs-2.1 behavior::
Wildcard characters are accepted for the `@ApplicationPath` annotation, for example, `@ApplicationPath(value="/rest1/*")`.

restfulWS-3.0 behavior::
Wildcard characters are not accepted for the @ApplicationPath annotation. All such requests are rejected.
