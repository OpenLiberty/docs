= Logstash collector events reference list


You can use the Logstash collector feature to send log events to a remote Logstash server so that you can manage and visualize them with products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana. Each type of log event has its own set of fields that you can use to customize your Kibana dashboard.

The xref:reference:feature/logstashCollector-1.0.adoc[Logstash collector feature] captures log events at run time, breaks them into fields, and securely forwards them to the configured Logstash log collection server. For more information, see xref:forwarding-logs-logstash.adoc[Forwarding logs and events to Logstash with Logstash collector].


== Event types

The Logstash collector feature generates the following event types:


- <<Message events,Message events>>
- <<Trace events,Trace events>>
- <<HTTP access events,HTTP access events>>
- <<FFDC events,First failure data capture (FFDC) events>>
- <<Garbage collection events,Garbage collection events>> for IBM JDKs
- <<Supported audit events and their audit data,Audit events>>

In addition to the default log and trace framework, the Logstash collector feature forwards message events and trace events when binary logging is enabled.
For more information about log event types, see xref:log-management.adoc[Log management].

== Supported audit events and their audit data

The Open Liberty xref:reference:feature/audit-1.0.adoc[Audit feature] captures auditable events from the server runtime environment and applications. You can use the data that is generated from the audit events to analyze the configured environment. For audit event examples, see xref:json-log-events-list.adoc#_supported_audit_events_and_their_audit_data[JSON log events reference list: Audit events].

Open Liberty can generate audit events in either JSON or xref:audit-log-events-list-cadf.adoc[CADF format]. The audit events are captured in the following JSON format types to help identify different areas where the configured environment can be improved:

* <<SECURITY_AUDIT_MGMT, Management of the audit service (SECURITY_AUDIT_MGMT)>>
* <<SECURITY_MEMBER_MGMT, SCIM operations/member management (SECURITY_MEMBER_MGMT)>>
* <<SECURITY_API_AUTHN, Servlet 3.0 APIs: login/authenticate (SECURITY_API_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_API_AUTHN_TERMINATE, Servlet 3.0 APIs: logout (SECURITY_API_AUTHN_TERMINATE)>>

== Server and host names in virtualized environments

When Open Liberty servers are running in Docker containers or other virtualized environments, the hostName and serverName fields are automatically set according to certain variables in the configuration.

The hostName field is set to the first of the following values that is available:

- The value of the `CONTAINER_HOST` environment variable
- The value of the `${defaultHostName}` Open Liberty configuration variable
- The canonical hostname as reported by the JDK

The serverName field is set to the first of the following values that is available:

- The value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable
- The value of the `${wlp.server.name}` Open Liberty configuration variable


When Open Liberty servers run in Docker containers or other virtual environments that you manage, set the `CONTAINER_HOST` and `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variables when you run your image. These environment variables ensure that the Logstash collector feature tags the records that it sends with the appropriate host and container name, which aids in problem determination. If you do not set these environment variables, you might find it difficult to determine which container sent which events when you use a dashboard that shows events from multiple containers.

When you start a Docker container, use a command similar to the following example to set these environment variables:

[source,command]
----
docker run -d -e LICENSE=accept -e CONTAINER_NAME=yourContainerName -e CONTAINER_HOST=yourContainerHost --name=yourContainerName yourImageName
----

When Open Liberty servers run in the IBM Cloud® Kubernetes Service, the `CONTAINER_HOST` and `CONTAINER_NAME` are already set for you.
