Jakarta EE is an open source Java platform for building enterprise applications. It includes and extends the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), by providing specifications for common services such as transaction management, security, and database access.

https://jakarta.ee[Jakarta EE] specifies APIs and a runtime environment to develop and run secure, scalable networked applications. It also defines a container model to manage application components. Jakarta EE application servers such as Open Liberty host these containers and provide standardized system services that any application that is developed for Jakarta EE specifications can use. These open source specifications make applications more portable and resilient and help developers focus on writing applications rather than managing infrastructure.

Jakarta EE is widely used for enterprise applications in banking, e-commerce, travel, and more. The system services that it enables are especially valuable to cloud-native and microservice-based applications. These services abstract away some of the complexity of handling requests from web-based clients, communicating with databases, and implementing security measures. Jakarta EE specifies APIs to facilitate these functions and many others so that enterprise Java applications can carry out their business logic, regardless of the environment in which they run.

== Java platforms

Jakarta EE was formerly known as Java EE, one of four Java platforms that are owned by the Oracle corporation that are designed to standardize and simplify Java application development. Oracle moved Java EE to the open source Eclipse foundation in 2017, at which time its name was changed to Jakarta EE. The other three platforms are Java SE, which provides the core Java functions; Java ME, which provides resources for mobile applications; and JavaFX, which provides graphics and media packages for rich client applications.

All Java platforms provide an API to standardize application development and a Java virtual machine (JVM), which is a program that runs Java applications.
Jakarta EE consists of a superset of Java SE and a collection of APIs that are designed for networked enterprise application development. Java SE provides the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is used to run Java applications, and the Java Software Development Kit (SDK), which is a collection of tools for developing Java applications. The JRE includes the JVM and the Java Class Library (JCL), which is a set of dynamically loadable libraries that the JVM can call at run time. These libraries enable Java applications to be operating system independent by supplying many of common functions that are provided by modern operating systems.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these components of the Jakarta EE platform:

Jakarta EE::
A platform for developing and running multitiered, web-based applications that includes Java SE and a collection of APIs to standardize common services

Java SE::
A platform for developing and running Java applications that includes the Java SDK and JRE

* Java SDK: a collection of software development tools that includes the JRE, a set of API classes, and a Java compiler
** JRE: a runtime environment for Java applications that includes the JVM and JCL
*** JVM: a virtual machine that interprets and executes Java application functions
*** JCL: a collection of standard code libraries that provides basic functions, such as container classes and regular expression processing, regardless of the underlying operating system where an application runs.

=== Platform versions
Java SE evolved through a series of versions as more classes were added to the JCL, new APIs were introduced, and some older functions were deprecated and replaced. Currently, the only versions of Java SE that are maintained with long-term support are Java SE 8 and Java SE 11.
Java EE 8 was the last release of the platform by the Oracle corporation before it was moved to the Eclipse foundation, which first released the platform as Jakarta EE 8. Jakarta EE 9 arrived in 2020. The primary change in this release was to replace `javax.*` with `jakarta.*` in Jakarta package names.

== Jakarta EE specifications

Jakarta EE extends Java SE by specifying APIs that enable enterprise applications to manage transactions, communicate with databases, configure application security, and more. Applications that run on Open Liberty can take advantage of these APIs by enabling the corresponding xref:reference:feature/feature-overview.adoc[Open Liberty features] in the server configuration. The following table describes several of the most commonly used Jakarta EE specifications and lists their corresponding Open Liberty features. The _Try it out_ column provides links to Open Liberty guides that demonstrate how Open Liberty implements the specification.

|===

Ongoing development of Jakarta EE specification is advanced by the Jakarta developer community through Java Specification Requests (JSRs), which are descriptions of updates and new specifications for the platform. Jakarta EE compatible runtimes, such as Open Liberty, implement the functions that the JSRs describe. Each implementation is verified by the community through a Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). A TCK is a rigorous battery of tests that checks the compliance of a JSR reference implementation. For a JSR to become an official specification, it must be ratified through the process of developing at least one reference implementation that satisfies the TCK tests.

== Jakarta EE and Open Liberty

Open Liberty is a Jakarta EE compatible runtime for building cloud-native Java applications and microservices. It supplies implementations of Jakarta EE platform APIs to applications so that developers can focus on application business logic rather than the underlying frameworks. Open liberty helps web enterprise applications to be dynamic, scalable, and portable by providing the code to implement the system services that Jakarta EE specifies.

Open Liberty is a reference implementation of Jakarta EE, which means it implements all the required Jakarta EE specifications. The Open Liberty team's involvement with Jakarta EE goes back the beginning of the project. Our team is active across the https://jakarta.ee/about/[Jakarta Working Group], with https://github.com/kwsutter[Kevin Sutter] serving as a co-Release Lead, Dan Bandera and https://github.com/irobins[Ian Robinson] sitting on the Steering Committee, and https://github.com/nottycode[Alasdair Nottingham] directing the implementation on Open Liberty.
Our developers are committers to numerous Jakarata EE specifications, including https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jca/who[Jakarta Connectors], https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.cu/who[Jakarta Concurrency], and https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxws/who[Jakarta XML Web Services]. We are also taking a leading role in the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform/who[Jakarta EE Platform] umbrella specification.


As new specification versions are introduced, Open Liberty implements them in new versions of its xref:reference:feature/eature-overview.adoc[modular features]. The Open Liberty xref:zero-migration-architecture.adoc[zero migration architecture] gives you the flexibility to continue to use the same version of an API or upgrade to newer versions according to the needs of your applications. New versions of Jakarta EE implementing features are regularly introduced in xref:installing-open-liberty-betas.adoc[Open Liberty beta releases] before they are included in a full GA release.
