= Send and receive multipart/form-data parts in JAX-RS

You can send different types of file data in a single HTTP request by using the `multipart/form-data` content type. Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) resources that run on Open Liberty can send and receive `multipart/form-data` parts to and from clients.

The `multipart/form-data` content type is often used for form data in web applications. This content type can send multiple attachments, which are called parts, as a multipart payload in a single HTTP request. For example, a form that you use to upload a resume PDF file, a photo, and text for your name and address might send this content as `multipart/form-data` parts. JAX-RS resources can implement the `multipart/form-data` content type to receive such form data from a client. They can also use this content type to send multipart payloads back to a client in response to an HTTP request.

You can send and receive `multipart/form-data` parts with JAX-RS resources in Open Liberty by enabling the feature:restfulWS[display=Jakarta RESTful Services] feature and implementing the necessary code in your JAX-RS resource methods.

== Send multipart/form-data parts from JAX-RS resources

One way to send multipart form data in an HTTP request is to use an HTML form. You might create an HTML form for a human user to send file data to a web application. The following example shows an HTML form that sends an HTTP request in three parts that each specifies a particular content type:

[source,HTML]
----
<form action="http://www.example.com/" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="fileid" />
    <br />
    <input type="text" name="description" />
    <br />
    <input type="file" name="thefile" />
    <br />
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit"/>
</form>
----
In this example, the `type` attribute in the `input` element specifies the content type for each part of the HTTP request.

However, if you want to automate the transfer of form data, you can write a JAX-RS client that sends a multipart payload. For example, you might create a microservice that automatically submits a purchase order when it receives a certain low inventory event.
To send a multipart payload, you must send a list of `IAttachment` objects. Each `IAttachment` object in that list represents a single part in the multipart payload. In the following example, a JAX-RS client sends a `POST` request to a remote service. The request has three parts: an XML file, an ID string for the file, and a text description of the file.

[source,java]
----
List<IAttachment> attachments = new ArrayList<>();

attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("fileid")
                                 .inputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream("person1234".getBytes()))
                                 .build());

attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("description")
                                 .inputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream("XML file about person1234".getBytes()))
                                 .build());

File file = new File("/path/to/multipart-response/person.xml");
attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("thefile")
                                 .inputStream("person.xml",new FileInputStream(file))
                                 .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_TYPE)
                                 .build());

Client c = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget target = c.target("http://localhost:9080/myMultipartApp/person");
Response r = target.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
                   .header("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data")
                   .post(Entity.entity(attachments, MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_TYPE));

if(r.getStatus()==200 && "test".equals(r.readEntity(String.class)) {
    System.out.println("multipart upload succeeded");
}
----

In this example, the `IAttachment` list contains `attachments` objects for the XML file, ID, and description. These objects form the parts of the multipart payload. Each part implements an `InputStream` object to represent the data that is being transferred as an ordered stream of bytes.

Normally, you must close an `InputStream` object by calling the `InputStream close()` method. However, if you are sending multipart payloads in Open Liberty, do not close the `InputStream` object. Open Liberty closes it for you after the data is sent. The server throws an `IOException` error if the stream is closed beforehand.

== Receive multipart/form-data parts with JAX-RS resources

To receive a multipart payload, a JAX-RS resource must implement a method to receive the `multipart/form-data` parts of an HTTP request, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Consumes("multipart/form-data")
public Response postFormData(List <IAttachment> attachments) throws IOException{
    InputStream stream = null;
    for (IAttachment attachment : attachments) {
         if (attachment == null) {
             continue;
         }
         String contentType = attachment.getDataHandler().getContentType();
         System.out.println("Content-type: " + contentType);
         String fileName = attachment.getDataHandler().getName();
         }
         if (fileName == null) {
             StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
             BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));
             String line = null;
             try {
                 while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                     sb.append(line);
                 }
             } catch (IOException e) {
                 e.printStackTrace();
             } finally {
                 if (br != null) {
                     try {
                         br.close();
                     } catch (IOException e) {
                         e.printStackTrace();
                     }
                 }
             }
             System.out.println("Non-file attachment value: " + sb.toString());
         } else {
             File tempFile = new File(fileName);
             System.out.println("File: " + tempFile.getAbsolutePath());
         }
         if (stream != null) {
            stream.close();
         }
    }
    return Response.ok("test").build();
}
----

With this configuration, Open Liberty can pass a `List<IAttachment>` instance to your resource method so that you can process each part of the multipart payload. How you process the list of `IAttachment` depends on the needs of your application. In this example, the `postFormData` method iterates over each part and checks to see whether that part contains a file or not. It then prints the content type and contents of the part to the console output (`System.out`).

When your application receives a multipart payload, Open Liberty does not close the `InputStream` object because the server does not know when the application is done processing it. You must explicitly close the object in your application code. In the previous example, the `stream.close` method closes the `InputStream` object individually for each part of the multipart payload.
