:seo-title: Audit logs event list - OpenLiberty.io
= Audit log events reference list (CADF format)

The Open Liberty Audit feature captures auditable events that contain security details from the server runtime environment and applications. You can use the data that is generated from the audit events to analyze the configured environment.

Open Liberty can generate audit events in either CADF or xref:ROOT:json-log-events-list.adoc[JSON format]. The audit events can be captured in the following CADF format types to help identify different areas where the configured environment can be improved:

* <<SECURITY_AUDIT_MGMT, Management of the audit service (SECURITY_AUDIT_MGMT)>>
* <<SECURITY_MEMBER_MGMT, SCIM operations/member management (SECURITY_MEMBER_MGMT)>>
* <<SECURITY_API_AUTHN, Servlet 3.0 APIs: login/authenticate (SECURITY_API_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_API_AUTHN_TERMINATE, Servlet 3.0 APIs: logout (SECURITY_API_AUTHN_TERMINATE)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN_TERMINATE, Form Logout (SECURITY_AUTHN_TERMINATE)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN, Basic Authentication (SECURITY_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN, Client certificate authentication (SECURITY_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN, Form Login Authentication (SECURITY_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN_DELEGATION, Servlet runAs delegation (SECURITY_AUTHN_DELEGATION)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN_DELEGATION, EJB delegation (SECURITY_AUTHN_DELEGATION)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHN_FAILOVER, Failover to basic authentication (SECURITY_AUTHN_FAILOVER)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHZ, Unprotected servlet authorization (SECURITY_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHZ, JACC web authorization (SECURITY_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHZ, JACC EJB authorization (SECURITY_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_AUTHZ, EJB authorization (SECURITY_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_JMS_AUTHN, JMS Authentication (SECURITY_JMS_AUTHN)>>
* <<SECURITY_JMS_AUTHZ, JMS Authorization (SECURITY_JMS_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_SAF_AUTHZ, SAF Authorization Service API request (SECURITY_SAF_AUTHZ)>>
* <<SECURITY_SAF_AUTHZ_DETAILS, SAF Authorization Exception (SECURITY_SAF_AUTHZ_DETAILS)>>
