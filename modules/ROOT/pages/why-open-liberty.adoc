= Why Open Liberty?

Open Liberty is a lightweight Java runtime for building cloud-native applications and microservices. It is compatible with MicroProfile and with the Jakarta EE Full Platform and Web Profile specifications.

With Open Liberty, you can add and remove modular features from the latest versions of Eclipse MicroProfile and Jakarta EE.
This modular structure simplifies application development, so you run only the features that your application needs. You have the flexibility to create the right size deployment for your applications.
Furthermore, thanks to continuous delivery releases and zero-migration architecture, you can upgrade to the latest version of Open Liberty with minimal impact on your current applications and configurations.
For updates about Open Liberty features and capabilities, see the link:https://openliberty.io/blog/[Open Liberty blog] and https://openliberty.io/docs/[Open Liberty Docs].

== Choose the right package size for your applications

Open Liberty is a flexible solution for developing and deploying applications that can scale from small microservices all the way up to full modern enterprise monoliths, and anything in-between. 

The following table shows disk and memory measurements for three example Open Liberty runtime packages. The example in the first row contains all the latest APIs for both Java EE or Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, all you need for a modern cloud-native monolith. The example in the second row contains enough runtime to support MicroProfile 3.3, all you need for a typical microservice. The example in the third row contains enough runtime to run Servlet 4.0, the absolute minimum you need to run a simple web framework. For each of these use cases, Open Liberty disk and memory requirements scale to match the needs of the system so that no unnecessary resources are used.

|===

Open Liberty runtime packages of various sizes and all Open Liberty features are available from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.openliberty[the Maven Central repository], so you can choose the package and features that suit your needs.

== Build, test, and debug with container-aware, continuous delivery-focused developer tools

Open Liberty has a strong focus on helping developers to be productive with tools of their choice. Open Liberty integrates with the most popular build tools, Maven and Gradle, and releases all runtime binary files to Maven Central. 

Maven and Gradle support also enable Open Liberty xref:development-mode.adoc[development mode], so the  code and configuration changes that you make take immediate effect on a local running server. 
With development mode, Open Liberty automatically detects changes in your code, compiles them, and deploys them to your running server.
You can run tests on demand, or even automatically, so that you get immediate feedback on your changes.

True-to-production integration testing means you test your applications in the same environment that you use in production. You can run true-to-production integration tests for your Open Liberty applications by using the xref:integration-testing.adoc[MicroShed testing framework]. MicroShed runs JUnit integration tests against an Open Liberty application that is running in a container, including integration with containers that run databases and Kafka.

== Stay current and secure with continuous delivery and zero migration

Modernizing your applications to cloud-native and microservices  often leads to a shift in runtime ownership responsibility. A single multidisciplinary team develops, packages, and deploys an application or microservice as an immutable container that includes the server runtime. Development teams might deliver scores of applications, each of which embeds a runtime. These teams are responsible for ensuring that those runtimes are current and free from vulnerabilities. 

Open Liberty addresses this challenge with a continuous delivery release cycle. A new release of the runtime arrives every 4 weeks. Every Open Liberty release is available in Maven Central and Docker Hub, making it simple to pick up the latest updates through build automation. Development teams can simply rebuild their containers to pull in the latest release. 

Furthermore, with Open Liberty zero-migration architecture, you focus on writing your applications, not the APIs changing under you.
Zero-migration architecture means that you can use existing, unmodified configuration and application files with an updated version of Open Liberty, without unexpected changes in behavior. In just a matter of minutes, you can move up to the latest version Open Liberty without having to change your application code or configuration.

Open Liberty offers full compatibility between product versions so that your existing APIs and behaviors are supported in each new release. For more information, see xref:zero-migration-architecture.adoc[Zero-migration architecture].

The combination of continuous delivery and zero migration makes it easy to stay up to date and gives you the flexibility to invest in application changes on your own schedule.

== Optimize container orchestration with auto-tuning and Kubernetes native integration

Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration. With Kubernetes-based platforms, such as OpenShift, you can deploy containers and scale them up or down according to the needs of your application. Kubernetes operators are software extensions for Kubernetes that help you configure and manage containerized applications. https://operatorhub.io/operator/open-liberty[The Open Liberty Operator] simplifies deployment and configuration of applications, clustering, persistence integration, service binding, problem determination, and more.

Container-based microservices need a runtime that can achieve optimum application performance, regardless of where the container is deployed.
A properly tuned thread pool can maximize throughput, reduce response times, and increase the capacity for concurrent requests.
However, containerization makes performance tuning more complex. Open Liberty addresses this complexity with effective default settings that rarely require adjustment. Additionally, the Open Liberty thread pool is auto-tuning. Application code in Open Liberty runs in a single thread pool that is called the default executor.
The size of this pool is set by xref:thread-pool-tuning.adoc[an auto-tuning controller], which can manage a wide range of workloads.

== Protect applications and servers
Open Liberty supports application security with a robust set of security features.
During development and testing, Open Liberty's built-in xref:user-registries-application-security.adoc#_basic_user_registries_for_application_development[basic user registry and the QuickStart security element] offer easily configurable security frameworks to test access to your application in a lightweight, self-contained manner.
The `securityUtility` command supports plain text encryption, so you can easily xref:password-encryption.adoc[secure user passwords] with hash encoding.

After deployment, the xref:reference:feature/appSecurity-3.0.adoc[Application Security feature] provides the core capability for the Jakarta EE Security API, while the xref:reference:feature/transportSecurity-1.0.adoc[Transport Security feature] enables secure TLS connections by using HTTPS.
The xref:user-registries-application-security.adoc#_ldap_user_registries_for_applications_in_production[LDAP User Registry] feature supports authentication and authorization to external LDAP registries.
Open Liberty also provides features to support xref:single-sign-on.adoc[a range of single sign-on options], including JSON Web Tokens, OpenID Connect, SAML Web, and SPNEGO.


== Gather and analyze metrics
You can xref:microservice-observability-metrics.adoc[gather detailed metrics on your applications] that run on Open Liberty with MicroProfile metrics. Metrics are essential to building observability into applications so that operations teams can monitor application behavior effectively. You use metrics to pinpoint issues, collect data for capacity planning, or to decide when to scale a service to run with more or fewer resources. https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/[MicroProfile Metrics] provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by your Open Liberty server and its deployed applications.

After you configure metrics, you can link:/blog/2020/01/29/alerts-slack-prometheus-alertmanager-open-liberty.html[get alerts from your Open Liberty apps by using Prometheus Alertmanager]. You can also link:/blog/2020/04/09/microprofile-3-3-open-liberty-20004.html#gra[compile your metrics data into visualizations in Grafana dashboards] to spot potential problems in your applications.

== Try it out

Open Liberty provides a diverse library of developer guides that are designed to give you firsthand experience with the configuration and features that support cloud-native development.
The guides cover a wide range of development and production scenarios and can be adapted as reference templates for developing your own applications. link:/guides/[Browse the guides] and learn how to build, package, and deploy applications and microservices with Open Liberty.
