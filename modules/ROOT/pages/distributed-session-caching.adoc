Caching sessions in your applications helps improve performance and availability for the end users.
The `sessionCache`feature in Open Liberty provides failover of non-persistent user session data with distributed in-memory HttpSession caching.
You can store sessions locally on a server, on a relational database, or in-memory of your application.
However a cached session on the server can be lost if the application instance fails.
Also, a relational database might not be always available.
 The `sessionCache` feature in Open Liberty provides distributed in-memory HttpSession caching.
 The `sessionCache` feature builds on top of an existing technology called JCache (JSR 107) that offers a standardized distributed in-memory caching API.
 Though the feature builds on top of JCache, no direct usage of JCache API is necessary in your application, since Liberty handles the session caching in its HttpSession implementation.
 If your application is already using HttpSession caching, it can benefit from sessionCache-1.0 without making any code changes.
 == Configuring session caching
 The `sessionCache` feature does not include a JCache implementation, so you need to pick one and reference it as a library in your `server.xml` file.
 For development purposes, you can use the Hazelcast open source implementation or any other implementation that complies with the JCache specification.

 To configure the JCache Session Persistence feature, include the following configuration in your `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]
 ----
 <server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>sessionCache-1.0</feature>
    <feature>servlet-4.0</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <httpSessionCache libraryRef="JCacheLib"/>
  <library id="JCacheLib">
    <file name="/usr/lib/hazelcast.jar"/>
  </library>
</server>
 ----
 == Session caching in your application
 Distributed session caching with sessionCache-1.0 works the same way as non-distributed session caching in an application.
 If your application caches data, no code changes are needed to include the `sessionCache` feature.
 The following example shows what the HTTP session caching might look like:

 [source, xml]
 ----
 @WebServlet("/ExampleServlet")
public class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        HttpSession session = req.getSession();
        Object dbThing = session.getAttribute("dbThing");

        if (dbThing == null) {
            dbThing = getFromDB(); // Some expensive operation
            session.setAttribute("dbThing", dbThing);
        }
    }
}
 ----

 == Joining multiple servers together

 The `sessionCache-1.0` feature is only useful when it is connected to at least one other member.
 There are two different ways an Open Liberty server can behave in a cluster:

. Client-Server model: A Liberty server can act as the JCache client and connect to a dedicated JCache server.

. Peer-to-Peer model: A Liberty server can connect with other Liberty servers that are also running with the sessionCache-1.0 feature and configured to be part of the same cluster.

The following code shows a simple example of how two Liberty servers might share information that has been cached in an HttpSession:

[source, xml]
----
@WebServlet("/ServiceA")
public class ServiceA extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        HttpSession session = req.getSession();
        session.setAttribute("foo", "bar");
    }

}
----

[source, xml]
----
@WebServlet("/ServiceB")
public class ServiceB extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        HttpSession session = req.getSession();
        String result = session.getAttribute("foo"); // will be "bar"
        System.out.println("Session attribute foo=" + result);
    }

}
----

Each JCache implementation configures the cluster instances independently.
For Hazelcast, a simple configuration file might look like the following example, though you donâ€™t need to specify any Hazelcast configuration file if you are happy with the default Hazelcast configuration:

[source, xml]
----
<hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config hazelcast-config-3.9.xsd"
           xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  <group>
    <name>myCluster</name>
    <password>super-secret</password>
  </group>
</hazelcast>
----

Next, reference the Hazelcast XML configuration file in your `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>sessionCache-1.0</feature>
    <feature>servlet-4.0</feature>
  </featureManager>


  <httpSessionCache libraryRef="JCacheLib" uri="file:${server.config.dir}/hazelcast-config.xml"/>

  <library id="JCacheLib">
    <file name="/usr/lib/hazelcast.jar"/>
  </library>
</server>
----
