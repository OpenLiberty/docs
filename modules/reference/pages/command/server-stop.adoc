= server stop command

The `server stop` command stops the named Open Liberty server.

Normal server stop includes a 30 second quiesce stage before the server shuts down. This quiesce stage allows time for shutdown preparation, such as stopping inbound listeners but allowing existing requests to complete. Applying the `--force` option to the stop command skips the quiesce stage. The `--force` option has no effect if server stop was already initiated. If you use the `--force` option, you might see unexpected exceptions in the `messages.log` file that occur after the server received the server stop command.

== Usage examples

Stop the `myserver` server with the quiesce stage:

----
server stop myserver
----

Force the `myserver` server to stop without the quiesce stage:

----
server stop myserver --force
----

== Syntax

Run the command from the `_path_to_liberty_/wlp/bin` directory.

[subs=+quotes]

options::
One or more optional parameters.

Normal server stop includes a quiesce stage before the server is shut down. The quiesce stage, a period of 30 seconds, allows services to perform pre-shutdown work; for example, inbound listeners are stopped but existing requests are allowed to complete.

|Code
|Explanation

|0
|OK. 0 indicates successful completion of the requested operation.

|1
|1 indicates invocation of a redundant operation, such as starting a started server or stopping a stopper server.
1 might also be returned if the JVM options that were used are not valid.

|2
|2 indicates that the server does not exist.

|>=20
|Exit codes that are greater than or equal to 20 indicate that an error occurred while performing the request. Messages are printed and captured in log files with more information about the error.
