The `auditUtility auditReader` command decrypts and unsigns an audit log that is encrypted, signed, or both.
The command must specify the locations of the audit log and the output file.
== Usage examples

The following example demonstrates the proper syntax to decrypt an audit log that is encrypted:

----
auditUtility auditReader
  --auditFileLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/logs/audit.log
  --outputFilelocation=c:/decryptedAuditLogs/decrypted_audit.log
  --encrypted=true
  --encKeyStoreLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/mykeystore.PKCS12
  --encKeyStorePassword=libertypwd
  --encKeyStoreType=PKCS12
----

The following example demonstrates the proper syntax to unsign an audit log that is signed:
----
auditUtility auditReader
  --auditFileLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/logs/audit.log
  --outputFilelocation=c:/unsignedAuditLogs/unsigned_audit.log
  --signed=true
  --signingKeyStoreLocation=c:/wlp/usr/servers/myserver/mySiginingKeystore.PKCS12
  --signingKeyStorePassword=libertypwd
  --signingKeyStoreType=PKCS12
----


== Syntax

Run the command from the `_path_to_liberty_/wlp/bin` directory.

|======================
|Option |Description
|`--auditFileLocation`=[_location of encrypted, signed, or encrypted and signed audit log_]       |Specify the fully qualified location of the audit log to decrypt and unsign. This option is required.
|`--outputFileLocation`=[_location of resulting decrypted and unsigned audit log_]        |Specify the fully qualified location of the resulting output log. This option is required.
|   `--debug`=[true{vbar}false]     |Specify `true` to enable trace. Debug is disabled by default.
|`--encrypted`=[true{vbar}false] | Specify `true` if the audit log is encrypted and `false` if it is not encrypted.
|`--encKeyStoreLocation`=[_fully-qualified file location of keystore used to store the certificate used to decrypt audit records._]|Specify the fully-qualified file location of the keystore that stores the certificate that is used to decrypt the audit records.

|`--encKeyStorePassword`=[_password_]|Specify the password for the keystore that contains the certificate that is used to decrypt the audit records.
|`--encKeyStoreType`=[JKS{vbar}JCEKS{vbar}PKCS12]|Specify the type of the encryption keystore. Supported keystore types are `JKS`, `JCEKS`, and `PKCS12`.
|`--signed`=[true{vbar}false]|Specify `true` if the audit log is signed and `false` if it is not signed.
|`--signingKeyStoreLocation`=[_fully-qualified file location of keystore used to store the certificate used to unsign audit records._]|Specify the fully-qualified file location of the keystore which stores the certificate used to unsign the audit records.
|`--signingKeyStorePassword`=[_password_]|Specify the password for the keystore that contains the certificate that is used to unsign the audit records.
|`--signingKeyStoreType`=[JKS{vbar}JCEKS{vbar}PKCS12]|Specify the type of the signing keystore. Supported keystore types are `JKS`, `JCEKS`, and `PKCS12`.
