|--sourceAppPath=path
|The path of the source application file to thin.
This option is required.

|--parentLibCachePath=directory
|The directory path of the parent read-only library cache. The parent library cache is searched first to locate existing libraries. If the library is not found, the library is stored in the writable library cache that is specified by the `--targetLibCachePath` option. If this option is not specified, no parent library cache is searched.
This option is not required.

|--targetLibCachePath=directory
|The directory path that is used to save the library cache. If this option is not specified, a `lib.index.cache` directory is created in the parent directory of the source application.
This option is not required.
