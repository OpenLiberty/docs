= featureUtility installFeature

The `featureUtility installFeature` command installs a single feature or a list of space-separated features.
You can use the `featureUtility installFeature` command to install features into Open Liberty from Maven Central, or from a Maven repository that's hosted inside your firewall.

You can modify the behavior of the `featureUtility installFeature` command by declaring environment variables in the shell environment or by specifying properties in the `featureUtility.properties` file that's located in the `{wlp.install.dir}/etc/` directory. For example, you can define a local Maven repository to override Maven central when you install a feature. For more information, see xref:command/featureUtility-modifications.adoc[Modifications for featureUtility commands].

== Usage examples

Install the MicroProfile Health 2.2 feature from Maven Central:

----
featureUtility installFeature mpHealth-2.2
----

Install the MicroProfile Health 2.2 feature without caching the feature to the local Maven repository:

----
featureUtility installFeature mpHealth-2.2 --noCache
----

== Syntax

Run the command from the `_path_to_liberty_/wlp/bin` directory.

[subs=+quotes]
----
featureUtility installFeature _featureName_ [_options_]
----

featureName::
The name of the feature or features that you want to install.
You can include one or more space-separated features by specifying the feature shortname or the Maven coordinates.
If you specify the Maven coordinates, it must contain the group ID and the artifact ID, for example, `io.openliberty.features:mpHealth-2.2`.
If the version and packaging type aren't specified, the version defaults to the current runtime version and the packaging type defaults to an ESA file.
