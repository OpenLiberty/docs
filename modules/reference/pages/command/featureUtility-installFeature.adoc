The `featureUtility installFeature` command installs a single feature or a list of space-separated features.
You can use the `featureUtility installFeature` command to install features into Open Liberty from Maven Central, or from a Maven repository that's hosted inside your firewall.

You can modify the behavior of the `featureUtility installFeature` command by declaring environment variables in the shell environment or by specifying properties in the `featureUtility.properties` file that's located in the `{wlp.install.dir}/etc/` directory. For example, you can define a local Maven repository to override Maven central when you install a feature. For more information, see xref:command/featureUtility-commands.adoc#mod[Modifications for featureUtility commands].

The `featureUtility installFeature` command installs one or more Open Liberty features that you list on the command line. However, to automatically install all the features that are specified in your server configuration, use the xref:command/featureUtility-installServerFeatures.adoc[featureUtility installServerFeatures] command instead. The `featureUtility installServerFeatures` command is the recommended tool to install a specific set of features for your server in most cases.

== Usage examples

Install the MicroProfile Health 2.2 feature from Maven Central:

----
featureUtility installFeature mpHealth-2.2
----

Install the MicroProfile Health 2.2 feature without caching the feature to the local Maven repository:

----
featureUtility installFeature mpHealth-2.2 --noCache
----

Install the `userFeature-1.0` custom user feature from a Maven repository:
[subs=+quotes]
----
featureUtility installFeature userFeature-1.0 --featuresBom=my.user.features:myBOM:<runtime-version>
----
In this example, the `<runtime-version>` value is the version of the Open Liberty server where you want to install the feature, for example, `21.0.0.11`.

== Syntax

Run the command from the `_path_to_liberty_/wlp/bin` directory.

[subs=+quotes]
----
featureUtility installFeature _featureName_ [_options_]
----

featureName::
The name of the feature or features that you want to install.
You can include one or more space-separated features by specifying the feature shortname or the Maven coordinates.
If you specify the Maven coordinates, it must contain the group ID and the artifact ID, for example, `io.openliberty.features:mpHealth-2.2`.
If the version and packaging type aren't specified, the version defaults to the current runtime version and the packaging type defaults to an ESA file.

== Options

.Options for the featureUtility installFeature command
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Option
|Description

|--acceptLicense
|Accepts the license agreement for the feature if the feature has a different license from the Open Liberty server into which it's installed.

|--featuresBom
|Specifies the Maven coordinates for a features BOM file. Use this option to install custom user features from a Maven repository. Ensure that the repository also contains the associated features JSON file in the same group ID as the BOM.

|--noCache
|Specifies that features that are installed from a remote repository, such as Maven Central, aren't cached locally.

|--verbose
|Displays additional debug information while the action runs.

|--verify=_verify_option_
a|Specifies how features must be verified during a process or an installation.
Supported values are `enforce`, `skip`, `all`, and `warn`. If this option is not specified, the default value is `enforce`.

* `enforce`: Verifies the signatures of all Liberty features except for user features. It checks the integrity and authenticity of the features that are provided by the Liberty framework.
* `skip`: Choosing this option skips the verification process altogether. No feature signatures are downloaded or checked. It expedites the installation process but must be used with caution, as it bypasses an important security step.
* `all`: Verifies both the Liberty features and the user features. The features that are provided by the Liberty framework and any additional user features or components are checked for integrity.
* `warn`: Similar to the `all` option, warn also verifies both the Liberty features and user features. This option allows the process to continue, even if some feature signatures cannot be validated. A verification failure does not immediately end the installation process, but it results in a warning message.

|--to
|Specify the extension location to install user features. If this option is not specified, the feature is installed to default `{wlp.install.dir}/usr/extension` directory.
