The `featureUtility installServerFeatures` command installs the required features that are listed in the `server.xml` file of a server.

You can use the `featureUtility installServerFeatures` command to install both versioned and xref:reference:feature/versionless-features.adoc[versionless features].

== Usage example

Install the server features for the `myserver` server:

----
featureUtility installServerFeatures myserver
----

Install the features for the `myserver` server, which includes custom user features:

[subs=+quotes]
----
featureUtility installServerFeatures myserver --featuresBom=my.user.features:myBOM:<runtime-version>
----
In this example, the `<runtime-version>` value is the version of the Open Liberty server where you want to install the feature, for example, `21.0.0.11`.

== Syntax

Run the command from the `_path_to_liberty_/wlp/bin` directory.

[subs=+quotes]
----
featureUtility installServerFeatures _serverName_ [_options_]
----

serverName::
The name of the server to run the command against.

== Options

.Options for the featureUtility installServerFeatures command
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Option
|Description

|--acceptLicense
|Accepts the license agreement for the feature if the feature has a different license from the Liberty server into which it's installed.

|--featuresBom
|Specifies the Maven coordinates for a features BOM file. Use this option to install custom user features from a Maven repository. Ensure that the repository also contains the associated features JSON file in the same group ID as the BOM.

|--noCache
|Specifies that features that are installed from a remote repository, such as Maven Central, aren't cached locally.

|--verbose
|Displays additional debug information while the action runs.

|--verify=_verify_option_
a|Specifies how features must be verified during a process or an installation.
Supported values are `enforce`, `skip`, `all`, and `warn`. If this option is not specified, the default value is `enforce`.

* `enforce`: Verifies the signatures of all Liberty features except for user features. It checks the integrity and authenticity of the features that are provided by the Liberty framework.
* `skip`: Choosing this option skips the verification process altogether. No feature signatures are downloaded or checked. It expedites the installation process but must be used with caution, as it bypasses an important security step.
* `all`: Verifies both the Liberty features and the user features. The features that are provided by the Liberty framework and any additional user features or components are checked for integrity.
* `warn`: Similar to the `all` option, warn also verifies both the Liberty features and user features. This option allows the process to continue, even if some feature signatures cannot be validated. A verification failure does not immediately end the installation process, but it results in a warning message.

|--to
|Specify the extension location to install user features. If this option is not specified, the feature is installed to default `{wlp.install.dir}/usr/extension` directory.
