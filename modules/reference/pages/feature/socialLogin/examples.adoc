== Examples

The Social Media Login feature provides a set of built-in configuration elements for popular social media providers, in addition to generic configuration elements.
The following examples show how to configure different scenarios in the `server.xml` file.

=== Request log in with a social media ID

A customizable selection form is presented so the user can choose which provider they prefer to sign in with. The following example shows how to configure your application to request that the user logs in with their Google ID:

[source,xml]
----
<googleLogin clientId="your_app_id" clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />

<!-- protected apps need to have a security constraint defined -->
<application type="war" id="formlogin" name="formlogin" location="${server.config.dir}/apps/formlogin.war">
    <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="Employee">
            <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
        </security-role>
    </application-bnd>
</application>
----

=== Provide a choice of social media providers to the user

You can configure multiple social media providers for users to choose from.
The user receives a customizable selection form before authentication with the available providers.
The following example includes a choice of Google, GitHub, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter:


[source,xml]
----
<googleLogin clientId="your_app_id" clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<githubLogin   clientid="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<facebookLogin clientId="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<linkedinLogin clientId="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<twitterLogin  consumerKey="your_app_id"       consumerSecret="your_app_secret"/>

<!-- protected apps need to have a security constraint defined -->
<application type="war" id="formlogin" name="formlogin" location="${server.config.dir}/apps/formlogin.war">
    <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="Employee">
            <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
        </security-role>
    </application-bnd>
</application>
----

=== Request log in with a social media ID only if the users is also in another registry

You can restrict the presentation of a social media provider to only users who are also in another configured registry.
For example, use the `mapToUserRegistry` attribute to configure your app.
Thus, the user must authenticate through Google and also verify as an existing user in the company LDAP registry:

[source,xml]
----
 <googleLogin  mapToUserRegistry="true" clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret"   />

 <ldapRegistry ...> ... </ldapRegistry>

----

For more information on configuring an LDAP registry, see the LDAP User Registry (feature:ldapRegistry[]) feature.

=== Request log in with a social media ID or with their account for the configured registry

You can give users the option of logging in with either a social media provider or with their account on the configured registry. For example, use the `enableLocalAuthentication` attribute to configure your app so that users can have the option of logging in with a Google ID or with their account on their company's LDAP registry:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- user will be presented choice menu of either Google or ldap -->
<googleLogin  clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret" />

<socialLoginWebapp enableLocalAuthentication="true">

<ldapRegistry id="ldap" ...> ... </ldapRegistry>

----

=== Request log in with a social media ID for only a subset of applications, URLs, browsers, or IP addresses

To protect only a subset of applications, URLs, or IP addresses, use an authentication filter.
The security configuration takes effect only when the conditions in the filter are met. For example,
you might want a web app to be secured with the Social Media Login feature and a microservice app to be secured with the MicroProfile JWT (feature:mp-jwt[]) feature:

// tag::authfilter[]
[source,xml]
----
<!-- only requests with "/mywebapp" in them will be authenticated using Google. -->
<googleLogin  authFilterRef="authFilter1" clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret" />

<authFilter id="authFilter1">
    <requestUrl
        id="myUrlFilter"
        urlPattern="/mywebapp"
        matchType="contains" />
</authFilter>
----
// end::authfilter[]

For more information, see config:authFilter[].

=== Provide other social media logins as options to the user

To authenticate with a social media provider that is not configured out-of-the-box with Open Liberty, use a
config:oauth2Login[] (for OAuth providers) or config:oidcLogin[] (for OpenID Connect providers) element.
These elements supply the configuration details needed to work with the provider. These details can usually be
obtained from the social media provider's developer instructions.  Here is an example for Instagram:

[source,xml]
----
<oauth2Login id="instagramLogin" clientId="client_id" clientSecret="client_secret"
    scope="basic public_content"   responseType="code"
    tokenEndpointAuthMethod="client_secret_post"
    authorizationEndpoint="https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize"
    tokenEndpoint="https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token"
    userApi="https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self"
    userNameAttribute="username"
    website="https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/">
</oauth2Login>
----

=== Use OpenShift service accounts to authenticate and authorize protected resource requests

The `socialLogin-1.0` feature can be configured to use OpenShift service accounts to authenticate and authorize protected resource requests.
This configuration allows server administrators to secure endpoints, for example, monitoring and metrics endpoints that might produce sensitive information but require repeated access by an automated process or non-human entity.
Thus, the service accounts can authenticate themselves by providing a service account token that was created within the OpenShift cluster in the request.

To configure the socialLogin-1.0 feature ,specify the okdServiceLogin element.

[source,xml]
----
<server>

<featureManager>
  <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<okdServiceLogin />

</server>
----

The configuration assumes that the Liberty server is packaged and deployed within an OpenShift cluster.
By default, the `okdServiceLogin` element is used to authenticate all protected resource requests that the Liberty server receives.

Incoming requests to protected resources must include a service account token.
The token must be specified as a bearer token in the Authorization header of the request.
The Liberty server uses the service account token to query information about the associated service account from the OpenShift cluster.
The OpenShift project is used as the group for the service account for authorization decisions.
Similarly, the name of the service account is used as the username.

If the Liberty server is not deployed within an OpenShift cluster, the `userValidationApi` attribute must be configured to the value of the appropriate User API endpoint in the OpenShift cluster:

<okdServiceLogin userValidationApi="https://cluster.domain.example.com/apis/user.openshift.io/v1/users/~" />

Multiple `okdServiceLogin` elements can be configured if each element has a unique `id` attribute.
In those cases, authentication filters must also be configured so that appropriate endpoints are protected by a unique `okdServiceLogin` instance.
