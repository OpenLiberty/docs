The Audit feature introduces an infrastructure that serves two purposes:

 * Confirming the effectiveness and integrity of the existing configuration
 * Identifying areas where improvement to the configuration might be needed

The Audit feature can capture a range of auditable events that include
events related to authentication, authorization, and logout. The feature provides a default audit file handler implementation that emits human-readable audit records to a file-based log. Each audit record is emitted in JSON format.
