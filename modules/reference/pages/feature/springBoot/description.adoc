Open Liberty support for Spring Boot is integrated with support for the web container by using features like feature:servlet[display=Java Servlets
] and feature:jsp[display=JavaServer Pages]. Other features like feature:transportSecurity[display=Transport Security] or feature:websocket[Java Websocket] can be enabled if HTTPS or WebSocket support is needed. All other server configuration is handled by Spring Boot application properties. For example, security properties can be set by using `spring.security.*` application properties. The Open Liberty Spring Boot feature does not integrate with the functions that are provided by other Liberty features, such as feature:appSecurity[Application Security] and feature:jaxrs[Java Restful Services]. If an application needs functions similar to what is provided by these Open Liberty features, the Spring Boot project provides Spring Boot starters that can be included in the application. Including Spring Boot starters like https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web[spring-boot-starter-security] or third-party starters like https://cxf.apache.org/docs/springboot.html[cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxrs] in an application allows it to use technologies that are provided by the starter instead of using Liberty features.
