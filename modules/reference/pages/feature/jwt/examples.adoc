=== Construct JWT for an application

The following example shows how to configure the server to construct a JSON Web Token (JWT) for an application:

[source, xml]
----
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keyspass"/>

<jwtBuilder expiresInSeconds="600" id="myBuilder" issuer="https://example.com" keyAlias="default"/>
----

The `id` attribute for the `jwtBuilder` element that is named `myBuilder` identifies the JWT builder, and uses the default `keyAlias` attribute to locate the private key.
The `http://example.com` URL is the `issuer` attribute that identifies the principal, which issued the JSON Web Token.
The `expiry` attribute indicates the token expiration time, which is 600 seconds.
