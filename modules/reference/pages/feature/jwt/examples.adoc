== Examples

The JWT builder is used for the creation of JWTs.
The following example shows how to configure the server to construct a JWT for an application:

[source, xml]
----
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keyspass"/>

<jwtBuilder expiresInSeconds="600" id="myBuilder" issuer="https://example.com" keyAlias="default"/>

----

The `ID` attribute for the `jwtBuilder` element  named `myBuilder` is used to identify the JWT builder, and uses the default `keyAlias` attribute to locate the private key.
The `issuer` attribute in the example is the  URL `http://example.com`, which identifies who issued the JWT.
The `expiry` attribute indicates the token expiration time, which is 600 seconds.
