== Examples

The following examples provide feature configuration details for the SPNEGO feature.
To enable SPNEGO authentication, you must also configure your browser, Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC), and Open Liberty.
For more information, see xref:ROOT:configuring-spnego-authentication.adoc[Configuring SPNEGO authentication].

=== Apply SPNEGO authentication to a subset of HTTP requests
You can filter HTTP requests to require SPNEGO authentication for only certain requests, web applications, hosts, or user agents.
Specify attributes within the xref:config/authFilter.adoc[authFilter element] in the `server.xml` file to require SPNEGO authentication for certain requests, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
          <host id="myHost" name="example.com" matchType="contains" />
          <webApp id="myWebApp" name="protectedApp" matchType="equals" />
</authFilter>

<spnego id="mySpnego"
        includeClientGSSCredentialInSubject="false"
        krb5Config="server1/resources/security/kerberos/krb5.conf"
        krb5Keytab="server1/resources/security/kerberos/krb5.keytab"
        servicePrincipalNames="HTTP/myLibertyMachine.example.com"
        authFilterRef="myAuthFilter" />
</spnego>
----
This example configures the following points for SPNEGO authentication:

* The `authFilter` element specifies that SPNEGO authentication is used for any requests received that contain the `example.com` hostname for resources within the `protectedApp` web application.
* The `includeClientGSSCredentialInSubject` attribute is set to a value of `false` to indicate that client GSS credentials aren't added to the user subject upon successful authentication.
* The `krb5Config` and `krb5Keytab` attributes provide specific locations for the Kerberos configuration and keytab files within the server configuration directory instead of within their default locations.

=== Disable LTPA cookies for SPNEGO
By default, when a client is authenticated with Open Liberty, an LTPA cookie is created and sent to the HTTP servlet.
The following example disables LTPA cookies by specifying the `disableLtpaCookie` attribute with a value of `true` in the `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<spnego id="mySpnego" disableLtpaCookie="true" />
----

In this example configuration, LTPA cookies are disabled, so a mechanism other than LTPA cookies can be used for authentication.
For more information about about LTPA, see xref:ROOT:single-sign-on.html#_ltpa.adoc[Single sign-on].
