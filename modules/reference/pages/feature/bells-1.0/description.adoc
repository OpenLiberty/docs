The BELLS feature enables libraries to extend the Open Liberty runtime by allowing libraries to define the implementation of an Open Liberty SPI or API with Java `ServiceLoader` configuration files. These files are included in the `/META-INF/services/` directory of the library JAR file.

With the BELLS feature, a library declares a `/META-INF/services/` resource with the name of the fully qualified API or SPI interface, and provides a class that implements the interface. The feature processes the `/META-INF/services/` resources and provides the library interface implementation to the Open Liberty runtime.
