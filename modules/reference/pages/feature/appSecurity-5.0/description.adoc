If you are updating your application from using the `appSecurity-4.0` feature to using the `appSecurity-5.0` feature, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:diff/jakarta-ee10-diff.adoc#security[Differences between Jakarta Security 5.0 and 4.0].

The Application Security 5.0 feature supports the `OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation to configure a built-in OpenID Connect authentication mechanism. This authentication mechanism functions as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) as a single sign-on identity provider. For more information, see xref:ROOT:enable-openid-connect-client.adoc[Enable an OpenID Connect client for an application].
