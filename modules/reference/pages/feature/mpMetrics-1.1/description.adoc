MicroProfile metrics provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.
When the application runs, you can view your metrics from any browser by accessing the endpoint.

The MicroProfile Metrics feature also can provide access to metrics about server components when it is used in combination with the feature:monitor-1.0[display=Performance Monitoring] feature.

If you are updating your application from using MicroProfile Metrics 1.1 to using MicroProfile 2.0, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:javadoc:diff/mp-21-22-diff.adoc#metrics[Differences between MicroProfile Metrics 2.0 and 1.1].
