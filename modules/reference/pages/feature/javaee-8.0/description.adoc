If you are updating your application from using Java EE 8.0 features to using Jakarta EE 9.1 features, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:javadoc:diff/jakarta-ee-diff.adoc[Differences between Jakarta EE 9.1 and 8.0].

The `javaee-8.0` feature is functionally equivalent to the `jakartaee-8.0` feature. For more information, see xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee.adoc#platform[Jakarta EE Overview: Platform versions]
