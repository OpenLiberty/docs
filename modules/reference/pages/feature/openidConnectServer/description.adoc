The OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider feature is one of the several features that enables xref:ROOT:single-sign-on.adoc[Single sign-on (SSO)] in Open Liberty.
With this feature, you can authenticate users without the need to manage user credentials.
You can configure Open Liberty to act as an OpenID Connect provider.
With this configuration, users need to authenticate only once to access Open Liberty resources such as HTML, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and servlets.
Users can also access resources in multiple Open Liberty servers that share Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) keys.
This configuration is useful during development; when deployed into production in the cloud, applications typically use a cloud-hosted SSO provider such as Google.
