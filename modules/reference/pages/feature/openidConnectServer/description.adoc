Single sign-on (SSO) helps you to sign in once with your credentials to access multiple applications.
The OpenID Connect (OIDC) feature is one of the several features that enables SSO in Open Liberty.

With the OpenID Connect feature, developers can authenticate users without the need to manage user credentials.
You can configure Open Liberty to act as an OpenID Connect provider.
This configuration is useful during development; when deployed into production in the cloud, applications typically use a cloud-hosted SSO provider instead.
With this configuration, users need to authenticate once to access Open Liberty resources such as HTML, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and servlets.
Users can also access resources in multiple Open Liberty servers that share Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) keys.
