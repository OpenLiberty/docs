=== Managing OAuth clients with local store

The following example shows how to create a basic configuration to run an OpenID Connect Provider.
This configuration is useful in development and testing before deployment to the cloud.
During deployment to the cloud, the application uses a cloud-based SSO provider.
The example uses a xref:feature/appSecurity-3.0.adoc[basic registry] to manage a single user that is defined in the server configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keyspass" />

<basicRegistry id="basic" realm="customRealm">
    <user
      name="demouser"
      password="demopassword" />
</basicRegistry>

<openidConnectProvider id="OP"
    oauthProviderRef="OAuth"
    signatureAlgorithm="RS256" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore"
    jwkEnabled="true">
</openidConnectProvider>

<oauthProvider id="OAuth" tokenFormat="mpjwt" >
    <localStore>
      <client displayname="RP" enabled="true"
            name="RP" secret="thesecret"
            scope="openid profile email"
            preAuthorizedScope="openid profile email">
            <redirect>https://localhost:19443/oidcclient/redirect/RP</redirect>
      </client>
    </localStore>
</oauthProvider>

<oauth-roles>
    <authenticated>
        <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
    </authenticated>
</oauth-roles>
----

In the example, the `openidConnectProvider` element is configured to use the `oauthProvider` element.
The `signatureAlgorithm` attribute specifies the RS256 signature algorithm that is used to sign the ID token.
The `jwkEnabled` attribute that is set to `true`, indicates that the OpenID Connect provider supports JSON Web Keys (JWKs).
The OpenID Connect provider generates a JSON Web Key by using the certificate in the key store that is referenced by the `keyStoreRef` attribute.
The generated JSON Web Key is used to sign ID tokens.
OpenID Connect clients can contact the provider JWK endpoint to retrieve the corresponding signing key to verify the signatures of ID tokens that are issued by the provider.

The example configuration uses local store to store client data and token status.
Client data and token status are held in memory, which works for test and development purposes.
However, storing client data and token status in memory is not suitable to use for production purposes, as reconfiguring the server might clear the local store.
You can use a database instead of a local store in production.


=== Managing OAuth clients with an authenticated database

The following example uses a database as the store:

[source, xml]
----

<oauthProvider id="OAuth" tokenFormat="mpjwt" >

<localStore>
  <client displayname="RP" enabled="true"
        name="RP" secret="thesecret"
        scope="openid profile email"
        preAuthorizedScope="openid profile email">
        <redirect>https://localhost:19443/oidcclient/redirect/RP</redirect>
  </client>

  <clientManager>
     <user name="testuser" />
     <group name="oidcadmin" />
  </clientManager>
</localStore>
----

When you connect to a database, users in the `clientManager` role can add or modify clients by accessing the registration endpoint.
In the example, the `clientManager` role is granted to the user `testuser` or members of the `oidcadmin` group.
