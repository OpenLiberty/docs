Jakarta RESTful Web Services, formerly known as JAX-RS, is a xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee.adoc[Jakarta EE] platform API. In Open Liberty 21.0.0.12 and later, you can use Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0  client functions by enabling the feature:restfulWSClient[display=RESTful Web Services Client 3.0] feature. The JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 client implementations are available through the feature:jaxrsClient[display=Java RESTful Services Client] feature (`jaxrsClient-2.0` and `jaxrsClient-2.1`). The change in feature name and version reflects the change in API package name prefixes from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`, which is common to all Jakarta EE 9.1 features. For more information, see xref:reference:jaxrs-dif.adoc[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 behavior changes].
