Jakarta RESTful Web Services, formerly known as JAX-RS, is a xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee.adoc[Jakarta EE] platform API. In Open Liberty 21.0.0.12 and later, you can use Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0  client functions by enabling the feature:restfulWSClient[display=RESTful Web Services Client 3.0] feature. The JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 client implementations are available through the Java RESTful Services Client feature (feature:jaxrsClient-2.0[] and feature:jaxrsClient-2.1[]). The change in feature name and version reflects the change in API package name prefixes from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`, which is common to all Jakarta EE 9.1 features. For more information, see xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee-diff.adoc#restfulws[Differences between Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0 and Java Restful Services (JAX-RS)].
