== Configuring JWT SSO to change the token expiration time

With JWT SSO you can use a JSON Web Token (JWT) as a Single-Sign-On (SSO).
The following example shows how you can configure the JWT SSO to change the token expiration time.

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso cookieName="myjwt" jwtBuilderRef="myBuilder"/>

 <jwtBuilder id="myBuilder" expiresInSeconds="1800"/>
----

The `jwtBuilderRef` attribute refers to the `jwtBuilder` element myBuilder.
The `id` attribute for the `jwtBuilder` element  named `myBuilder` is used to identify the JWT builder.
The `expiresInSeconds` attribute indicates the token expiration time at 1800 seconds.

== Disabling JWT cookies

You can enable JWT SSO to accept authentication with an existing JWT cookie without generating the JWT cookie.
The following example shows how to disable the creating of JWT cookies.

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso id="sample" disableJwtCookie="true" />
----
