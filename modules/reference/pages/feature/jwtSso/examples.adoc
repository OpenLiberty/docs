== Change the token expiration time

With the `jwtSso` feature, you can use a JSON Web Token (JWT) as a Single-Sign-On (SSO) cookie.
The following example shows how you can configure the `jwtSso` feature to change the token expiration time:

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso cookieName="myjwt" jwtBuilderRef="myBuilder"/>

 <jwtBuilder id="myBuilder" expiresInSeconds="1800"/>
----

The `jwtBuilderRef` attribute refers to the `jwtBuilder` element `myBuilder`.
The `id` attribute for the `jwtBuilder` element that is named `myBuilder` identifies the JWT builder.
The `expiresInSeconds` attribute indicates the token expiration time that is set to 1800 seconds for a newly generated token.

== Disable JWT cookies

By default, when a client is authenticated with Open Liberty through the JWT SSO feature, a JWT cookie is created and sent to the HTTP servlet.
In the following example, the JWT cookies are disabled by specifying the `disableJwtCookie` attribute with a value of `true` in the `server.xml` file.
You can use a mechanism other than JWT cookies for authentication, as the JWT cookies are disabled in this example:

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso id="sample" disableJwtCookie="true" />
----

===  Configure authentication filter

You can configure an authentication filter to secure requests for accessing protected resources that are used with JWT SSO for authentication.
The `jwtSso` feature supports authentication filters.
For more information on configuring authentication filters, see xref:ROOT:authentication-filters.adoc[Authentication filters]. 

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso cookieName="myjwt" jwtBuilderRef="myBuilder" authFilterRef="myAuthFilter"/>

<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
         <requestUrl id="myRequestUrl" urlPattern="/SimpleServlet" matchType="contains"/>
</authFilter>
----

In the example, request URLs that contain the `/SimpleServlet` pattern are authenticated by using JWT SSO authentication.
If the `jwtSso` feature is enabled but `jwtSso` element does not include the `authFilterRef` attribute, all requests to access the protected resources that have a JWT cookie are used for the JWT SSO authentication.

=== Change JWT validation criteria

The `jwtSso` feature automatically uses the `mpJwt` element.
Only one `mpJwt` element can exist in the `server.xml` file.
The following example uses a `jwtBuilder` element reference to customize the creation of the tokens and an `mpJwt` element to customize validation and consumption of the tokens.

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso includeLtpaCookie="true" jwtBuilderRef="myBuilder">
<jwtBuilder id="myBuilder" issuer="http://server.example.com" />
<mpJwt id="myMpJwt" issuer="http://server.example.com"
keyName="myJwtSigner"/>
----

=== Use the JSON Web Key (JWK) endpoint to validate JWTs

The JWTs created by Open Liberty are signed by the issuer and verified by the consumer.
If you use multiple servers, you can store the issuer public key in the `truststore` file of the consumer.
Alternatively, you can also retrieve the key from the JWK endpoint of the issuer.

The default JWK endpoint is `http(s)://<host>:<port>/jwt/ibm/api/defaultJWT/jwk`.

[source, xml]
----
<jwtSso jwtBuilderRef="myBuilder"/> <jwtBuilder id="myBuilder" />
----

In the example, the JWK endpoint specifies the JWT builder with the ID `myBuilder`.
To use the JWK endpoint for consuming JWTs, add the `jwksUri` attribute to the `mpJwt` configuration element.

----
<mpJwt id="myMpJwt" jwksUri="https://localhost:19443/jwt/ibm/api/myBuilder/jwk" />
----
