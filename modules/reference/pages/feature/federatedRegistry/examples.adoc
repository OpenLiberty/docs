=== Default federation of user registries

If two or more user registries are configured in your `server.xml` file or in a `userRegistry.xml` file, you can combine them into a single federated user registry. When you enable the Federated User Registry feature, any user registries that are defined in your `server.xml` file or in a `userRegistry.xml` file are federated by default. This default federation applies to basic, LDAP, and custom user registries. However, user registries that are configured with the `quickStartSecurity` element cannot be federated with other user registries.

=== Custom federation of user registries

To federate a subset of user registries into a custom federated repository, you can define the `participatingBaseEntry name` attribute in the `federatedRepository` element. This configuration can be useful if you want to exclude certain user registries from a federated group by selectively including only the user registries that you want to federate. To avoid failures if any user registry is unavailable, set the `allowOpIfRepoDown` attribute on the `primaryRealm` subelement to `true`, as shown in the following example.

The following example shows the federation of a basic user registry and a custom user registry in a custom federated repository:

[source,java]
----
<federatedRepository>
    <primaryRealm name="PrimaryRealm" allowOpIfRepoDown="true">
        <participatingBaseEntry name="o=SampleBasicRealm1"/>
        <participatingBaseEntry name="o=customRegistryRealm1"/>
    </primaryRealm>
</federatedRepository>
----

The participating base entry for a user registry is defined by the `participatingBaseEntry` element. The participating base entry value for a custom or basic user registry is the `o` organization attribute set to equal the realm name of that user registry. The realm name for a user registry is the value that is returned from the `getRealm()` method of that user registry. The participating base entry for a custom user repository is one of the base entries that is returned by the `getRepositoryBaseEntries()` method for that repository.
