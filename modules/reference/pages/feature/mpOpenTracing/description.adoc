MicroProfile Open Tracing is stabilized. Although you do not need to change any of your existing applications and scripts that use a stabilized feature or feature capability, consider using the feature:mpTelemetry[display=MicroProfile Telemetry] feature instead.

For information about migrating from MicroProfile Open Tracing to MicroProfile Open Telemetry, see xref:ROOT:mp-50-60-diff.adoc#telemetry[Differences between MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 and MicroProfile OpenTracing 3.0].
