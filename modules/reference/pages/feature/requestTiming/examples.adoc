== Examples

=== Configure Slow and hung request thresholds
The following example sets the slow and hung request thresholds for all requests. The `requestTiming` element detects requests as slow if the requests require more than 10 seconds to complete, or as hung if the requests do not complete in 10 minutes:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming slowRequestThreshold="10s" hungRequestThreshold="10m">
</requestTiming>
----

=== Configure JDBC request thresholds
The following example sets the slow and hung JDBC request thresholds within the `requestTiming` element configuration. The `jdbcTiming` element detects that the JDBC request is slow if the request requires more than 500 ms to complete, or hung if the request does not complete in 5 minutes:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming slowRequestThreshold="10s" hungRequestThreshold="10m">
  <jdbcTiming dataSourceName="testDBSource" slowRequestThreshold="500ms" hungRequestThreshold="5m"/>
</requestTiming>
----
The `jdbcTiming` element configuration always overrides the `requestTiming` element configuration for the slow and hung request thresholds. The `jdbcTiming` element configuration can be only used to time a root level request.

=== Configure servlet request thresholds
The following example sets the slow and hung request thresholds for two servlets within the `requestTiming` element configuration. The `servletTiming` element detects that the `Arm10Servlet` servlet request is hung if the request does not complete in 20 seconds. The servlet request from the `SecurityExchangeApp` application is detected as hung if the request does not complete in 2 hours:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming slowRequestThreshold="10s" hungRequestThreshold="10m">
  <servletTiming servletName="Arm10Servlet" hungRequestThreshold="20s"/>
  <servletTiming appName="SecurityExchangeApp" hungRequestThreshold="2h"/>
</requestTiming>
----
The `servletTiming` element configuration always overrides the `requestTiming` element configuration for the slow and hung request thresholds. The `servletTiming` element configuration can be only used to time a root level request.

=== Control thread dump collection when hung requests are detected
When hung requests are detected with Request Timing, thread dumps are generated that contain the details of the events within the request. This collection of thread dumps can cause slower application performance. To control the collection of thread dumps, you can set the `enableThreadDumps` attribute to `"false"` in the `requestTiming` element, as shown in the following example:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming includeContextInfo="true" slowRequestThreshold="120s" hungRequestThreshold="10s" sampleRate="1" enableThreadDumps="false"></requestTiming>
----
When you set the `enableThreadDumps` attribute to `"false"`, thread dumps are not generated by hung requests. If the `enableThreadDumps` attribute is set to true or not specified at all, thread dumps are still generated.

You can also configure the `enableThreadDumps` attribute in an embedded `servletTiming` or `jdbcTiming` element. In the following example, the `enableThreadDumps` attribute is set to `"false"` in the `servletTiming` element:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming includeContextInfo="true" slowRequestThreshold="120s" hungRequestThreshold="10s" sampleRate="1">
    <servletTiming appName="MyApp" servletName="MyServletApp" slowRequestThreshold="100s" hungRequestThreshold="5s" enableThreadDumps="false"/>
</requestTiming>`
