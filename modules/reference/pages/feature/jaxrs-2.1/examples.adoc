=== Access security details with a context object

In JAX-RS applications, you can use annotations to add dependency injections of context objects that access information from HTTP requests. Context objects can provide information that is associated with the application such as the specific HTTP request or response, or the application environment. In the following example, the `@Context` annotation injects the `SecurityContext` context object in the Java API that provides access to security details, such as user credentials:

[source,java]
----
@Context
SecurityContext sec;

@GET
@Path("/getGroups")
public Set<String> getGroups() {
       Set<String> groups = null;
       Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal();
       if (user instanceof JsonWebToken) {
                JsonWebToken jwt = (JsonWebToken) user;
                groups= = jwt.getGroups();
       }
       return groups;
}
----

To access security details, the `SecurityContext` context object uses the `sec.getUserPrincipal()` method that determines the identity of the user that makes the HTTP request. The `if` statement specifies the `JSONWebToken` claims that identify the user.

=== Inject the MicroProfile JWT interface to access application resources

You can inject interfaces in JAX-RS applications to access resources, such as user details. In the following example, the `@Inject` annotation injects the `JsonWebToken` interface in the Java API to obtain the `jwtPrincipal` object that contains details from the MicroProfile JWT that identifies the user:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public class JwtEndpoint {
       @Inject
       private JsonWebToken jwtPrincipal;
       @GET
       @Path("/getInjectedPrincipal")
       public String getInjectedJWT() {
          return  this.jwtPrincipal.getName();
       }
}
