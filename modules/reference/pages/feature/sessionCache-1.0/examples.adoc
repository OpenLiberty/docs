=== Minimum configuration to persist session data with Hazelcast as the JCache provider

The following example shows the configuration of session persistence with Hazelcast as the JCache provider:

[source,xml]
----

<library id="jCacheVendorLib">
  <fileset dir="server1/hazelcast" includes="hazelcast.jar"/>
</library>

<httpSessionCache libraryRef="jCacheVendorLib"
                  uri="file:server1/hazelcast/hazelcast.xml"/>

----

The `library` element specifies that  Hazelcast must be used as the JCache provider, which is located in the `hazelcast.jar` library.
Additional Hazelcast configuration is provided in the `hazelcast.xml` file.
