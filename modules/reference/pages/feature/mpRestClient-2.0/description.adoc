With the release of the MicroProfile REST Client 3.0 feature (`mpRestClient-3.0`), the underlying MicroProfile REST Client implementation for Open Liberty changes from Apache CXF to RESTEasy. This change results in certain API behavior changes that might require you to update your application code if you are updating your application from using MicroProfile REST Client 2.0 to using MicroProfile REST Client 3.0. For more information, see xref:diff/mp-41-50-diff.adoc#rc[Differences between MicroProfile REST Client 3.0 and 2.0].
