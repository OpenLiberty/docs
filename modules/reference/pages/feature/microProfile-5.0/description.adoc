MicroProfile 5.0 aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1. With this release, applications can use MicroProfile APIs together with Jakarta EE 9.1 APIs. MicroProfile 5.0 has the same functions as MicroProfile 4.1 except for dependency updates that account for changes in Jakarta API package names from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`.

If you are updating your application from using MicroProfile 4.1 features to using MicroProfile 5.0 features, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:ROOT:mp-41-50-diff.adoc[Differences between MicroProfile 5.0 and 4.1].
