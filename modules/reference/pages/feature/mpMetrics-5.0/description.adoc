MicroProfile metrics provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.
When the application runs, you can view your metrics from any browser by accessing the endpoint.

If you are updating your application from using MicroProfile Metrics 4.0 to using MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:javadoc:diff/mp-50-60-diff.adoc#metrics[Differences between MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 and 4.0].
