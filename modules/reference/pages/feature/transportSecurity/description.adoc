When the Transport Security feature is enabled, the SSL context for the process is the default SSL context of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).
Therefore, the `SSLContext.getDefault()` method returns the default SSL context of the JSSE.
However, when this feature is enabled, Open Liberty also sets a custom SSL socket factory.
Therefore, the `SSLSocketFactory.getDefault()` method returns an SSL socket factory that is based on the Open Liberty custom socket factory provider, which uses the Open Liberty SSL context instead of the JSSE default.
