If you are updating your application from using the `restfulWS-3.0` feature to using the `restfulWS-3.1` feature, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. For more information, see xref:ROOT:jakarta-ee10-diff.adoc#restfulws[Differences between Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1 and 3.0].

In Jakarta Restful Web Services 3.0 and earlier, support for sending and receiving multipart/form-data parts was provided by the Liberty-specific `IAttachment` and `IMultipartBody` APIs, which are deprecated in version 3.1, which is included in Liberty 23.0.0.3. In this version and later, this support is provided by the `EntityPart` API that is defined in the RESTful Web Services specification. For more information, see link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/jakarta-restful-ws-spec-3.1.html#consuming_multipart_formdata[section 3.5.2 of the Jakarta Restful Web Services specification].
