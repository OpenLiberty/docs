=== Collect logs from specified sources

To enable the MicroProfile Telemetry feature to collect logs from different sources in the Open Liberty runtime environment, configure the `source` attribute for the config:mpTelemetry[] element with a comma-separated list of log sources.

[source,xml]
----
<mpTelemetry source="message, trace, ffdc"/>
----

* The `mpTelemetry` configuration element is optional. If you do not specify it, or if you do not include the `source` attribute, the default configuration source is `message`.

* If the source attribute is empty (`source=“”`), no sources are collected, and nothing is routed to the configured OpenTelemetry logs exporter.

* The attributes and values are case insensitive.
