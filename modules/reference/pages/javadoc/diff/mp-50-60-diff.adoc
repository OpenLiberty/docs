= Differences between MicroProfile 6.0 and 5.0

MicroProfile 6.0 is a major release. It includes Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile and replaces MicroProfile OpenTracing with MicroProfile Telemetry. 

Therefore, MicroProfile OpenTracing moves out of the umbrella release and becomes a stand-alone specification. For more information about Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile, see the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/coreprofile/10/[Core Profile specification].

If you are updating your application from using MicroProfile 5.0 features to using link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/6.0[MicroProfile 6.0] features, changes in API behavior might require you to update your application code. The following sections provide details about migrating your applications from MicroProfile 5.0 to 6.0:

- <<#openapi, Differences between MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1 and 3.0>>
- <<#jwt, Differences between MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 and 2.0>> 
- <<#metrics, Differences between MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 and 4.0>>
- <<#telemetry, Differences between MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 and MicroProfile OpenTracing 3.0>> 

[#openapi]
== Differences between MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1 and 3.0

The MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1 release introduces support for enhancing generated schemas by using information from Jakarta Bean Validation annotations. If you don't want this function, you can disable it by setting the `mp.openapi.scan.beanvalidation` MicroProfile Config property to `false`. This property can be set in any of the xref:external-configuration.adoc#default[configuration sources that are available to MicroProfile Config]. For more information, see https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.html#_jakarta_bean_validation_annotations[Jakarta Bean Validation Annotations] in the MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1 specification.

[#jwt]
== Differences between MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 and 2.0

The MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 introduces several new MicroProfile Config properties. For more information, see xref:microprofile-config-properties.adoc#jwt[MicroProfile Config properties: MicroProfile JSON Web Token].

[#metrics]
== Differences between MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 and 4.0

The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release introduces many changes to the specification and programming model that impact users who are migrating from MicroProfile Metrics 4.0.

=== SmallRye implementation of the specification

In previous versions, Open Liberty implemented the specification in its own codebase. However, starting in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, Open Liberty consumes the SmallRye implementation of the specification to produce the feature:mpMetrics-5.0[display=mpMetrics-5.0] feature.

=== Removed metric types 

The following metric types are removed from the MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release: 

- Concurrent gauge
- Simple timer
- Meter

[#metrics-updated]
=== Updated Metric types

The following metric types are modified in the MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release or have extra configuration properties from the SmallRye implementation:

- Histogram
+
The percentile precision can be configured by using the `mp.metrics.smallrye.histogram.precision` MicroProfile Config property. The value is from 1-5. Larger values result in a higher precision for calculating the percentiles at the cost of greater memory usage. The default value is set to 3.

- Timer
+
The timer metric no longer tracks throughput in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0. The API is updated to reflect this change.
+
The percentile precision can be configured by using the `mp.metrics.smallrye.timer.precision` MicroProfile Config property. The value is from 1-5. A larger value results in a higher precision for calculating the percentiles at the cost of greater memory usage. The default value is set to 3.

- Gauge
+
Gauges track only numerical values in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0.

- REST.Request metric
+
In earlier releases of MicroProfile Metrics, the `REST.Request` metric was instrumented with a `SimpleTimer` metric type. Starting in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the `SimpleTimer` metric type is no longer available and the metric is now instrumented with a `Timer` metric type.

=== Metadata

Starting in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the metric metadata no longer supports the display name (`displayName`) and metric type (`metricType`) attributes. 

=== User-defined Metric Registry scope

Starting in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, in addition to the default `application` metric registry scope, you can define your own metric registry scope to register metrics to. For more information, see xref:microservice-observability-metrics.adoc#customscope[User-defined metric registry scopes].

=== Metric tags

In previous releases, tags could be used to instrument multiple metrics with the same name if the tags had different values. Starting in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the set of tag names must be identical across all metric IDs with the same metric name. For more information, see xref:microservice-observability-metrics.adoc#_metric_tags[Metric tags].

Scope and application name tags::
In MicroProfile 5.0, the  `_app` tag that was defined in prior releases by the `mp.metrics.appName` MicroProfile Config property is now designated as `mp_app`.
The metric registry scope is also identified with a `mp_scope` tag. 
Both of these tags are reserved and if they are used when you instrument metrics, an `IllegalArgumentException` occurs.

=== REST endpoints

The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 specification redefines how the metrics output in the the `/metrics` REST endpoint is filtered with the scope and metric parameters. In previous releases, the REST endpoint used path parameters for querying metrics of a certain scope and metric name with the following syntax `/metrics/<scope>/<name>`. The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0  `/metrics` REST endpoint uses query parameters instead, in the following syntax `/metrics?scope=<scope>&name=<metric_name>`.

For example, a query for `base` metrics uses the `/metrics?scope=base` REST endpoint. A query for the `jvm.uptime` metric in the `base` scope uses the `/metrics?scope=base&name=jvm.uptime` REST endpoint.

[#output]
=== Metric output format

The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 specification removes the explicit requirement for the JSON output format to be made available. The SmallRye implementation that the Open Liberty runtime is using also removed JSON output from the `/metrics` endpoint. The specification now only requires that Prometheus-formatted metrics be made available through the `/metrics` endpoint.

The Prometheus-formatted output is also updated, including the following changes.

Metric registry scope:: 
The Metric Registry scope that a metric is associated to was indicated with a prefix of `base_` or `vendor_` in the Prometheus-formatted name. In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, this information is displayed with an `mp_scope` tag, for example, `{mp_scope="base"}`.

Histogram metric::
In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, metrics that are instrumented with a `Histogram` metric type have fewer formatted outputs than in previous releases, due to the removal of the `min`, `mean`, and `stddev` values. Furthermore, the formatting of the Prometheus output is changed. The suffix that defines the `Histogram` value trails after the unit suffix. For example, `bulkhead_waitingDuration_max_seconds` becomes `bulkhead_waitingDuration_seconds_max`.

Timer metric::
Timer metrics output is similar to the histogram output; the value suffix trails after the unit suffix.

Metric units::
In earlier releases, when a metric is instrumented and a unit is defined for it, the Prometheus output is scaled to the base unit. In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the unit that is associated to the metric is what is reflected in the Prometheus output. Output is not scaled to a base unit.

=== Integration with Micrometer

The SmallRye metrics implementation, on which Open Liberty bases its feature:mpMetrics-5.0[display=mpMetrics-5.0] feature, uses Micrometer as its core metrics library. You can configure the Open Liberty runtime to send metrics to the third-party metric monitoring systems that are supported by Micrometer. For more information, see xref:micrometer-metrics.adoc[Choose your own monitoring tools with MicroProfile Metrics].

[#telemetry]
== Differences between MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 and MicroProfile OpenTracing 3.0

In MicroProfile 6.0, MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 replaces MicroProfile OpenTracing 3.0 because the upstream link:https://opentracing.io[OpenTracing] project combined with OpenCensus to form the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project].

=== Configuration changes

In addition to replacing the `mpOpenTracing-3.0` feature with the `mpTelemtry-1.0` feature in your `server.xml` file, you must provide configuration to allow the MicroProfile Telemetry feature to connect to your distributed trace service. For more information, see xref:microprofile-telemetry.adoc[Enable distributed tracing with MicroProfile Telemetry]. 

You do not need to package a client for your particular tracing service. MicroProfile Telemetry includes exporters for Zipkin, the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) (which is used by Jaeger since v1.35), and the older Jaeger protocol. If you need to export to a different service, you can provide a custom exporter by using the link:https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi/1.19.0/io/opentelemetry/sdk/autoconfigure/spi/traces/ConfigurableSpanExporterProvider.html[ConfigurableSpanExporterProvider service provider interface (SPI)].

==== Selecting a compatible propagator

Several different standards are available to propagate span information between microservices by using HTTP headers. If you're upgrading microservices one at a time, you must enable a propagation method that is compatible with your other microservices.

The `otel.propagators` configuration property configures which propagators are used. The following values are available:

* `tracecontext`: link:https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C Trace Context] (usually used together with `baggage`)
* `baggage`: link:https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/[W3C Baggage]
* `b3`: link:https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation#single-header[B3 single header]
* `b3multi`: link:https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation#multiple-headers[B3 Multi header]
* `jaeger`: link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.21/client-libraries/#propagation-format[Jaeger]

You can use these values to specify one or more propagators. The default value is `tracecontext,baggage`.

If more than one propagator is enabled, then all headers are added to outgoing requests and any header is accepted for incoming requests. For example, if you are migrating from using a Jaeger client, you might set `otel.propagators=jaeger` to use the Jaeger propagation protocol. Alternatively, you might set `otel.propagators=jaeger,tracecontext,baggage` to allow use of both the Jaeger and W3C protocols.

=== API changes

The OpenTelemetry API replaces the OpenTracing API. Although these APIs are similar, any code that used the OpenTracing API must be updated to use the OpenTelemetry API. To simplify migration, the OpenTelemetry project created the OpenTracing shim, which converts OpenTracing API calls into OpenTelemetry API calls. This shim allows applications to be migrated piece by piece rather than all at once.

==== The @Traced annotation

The `@Traced` annotation is removed and how you migrate depends on where you were using it.

* For tracing a method on a CDI bean, use the `@WithSpan` annotation instead.
* No replacement is available for using the `@Traced(false)` annotation on a RESTful Web Services resource method to prevent tracing of calls to the method. All resource methods are traced automatically.
    ** You can use the link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector] to filter out spans for certain methods.

==== Start migrating by using the OpenTracing shim

Update your application dependencies to remove the OpenTracing API and add the OpenTelemetry API as a provided dependency and the OpenTracing shim as a regular dependency. For example, add the following dependencies in your Maven `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-instrumentation-annotations</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0-alpha</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-opentracing-shim</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0-alpha</version>
</dependency>
----

Just like the MicroProfile OpenTracing 3.0 feature (`mpOpenTracing-3.0`), the MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 feature (`mpTelemetry-1.0`) feature requires that you xref:microprofile-telemetry.adoc#manual[enable third-party APIs] to use the API classes in your application.

The shim converts most calls to the OpenTracing API into calls to the OpenTelemetry API, but it doesn't make the OpenTracing `Tracer` class available for injection.
To enable injection of the OpenTracing `Tracer` class, you also need to add a CDI Producer Method that uses the shim to provide instances of the class for injection. If CDI discovery is enabled, you can add the following class to your application:

[source,java]
----
import io.opentelemetry.api.OpenTelemetry;
import io.opentelemetry.opentracingshim.OpenTracingShim;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShimProvider {
    
    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    private Tracer provideTracer(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {
        return OpenTracingShim.createTracerShim(openTelemetry);
    }

}
----

With the configuration changes and the shim in place, your application can run and export traces to your trace service. However, be aware of the link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/migration/opentracing/#limits-on-compatibility[limitations on compatibility] for the shim.

==== Switch to the OpenTelemetry API

You can continue to use the OpenTracing API in your code with the OpenTracing Shim. However, you might want to switch to using the OpenTelemetry API directly to take advantage of new features and avoid the limitations of using the shim.

The OpenTelemetry API is similar to the OpenTracing API so the changes to your code are likely to be straightforward. Where you previously injected the `io.opentracing.Tracer` class, you must instead inject the `io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Tracer` class and use the methods on that class to create new spans.

As an example, take the following code for the OpenTracing API, which creates and activates a span around an operation:

[source,java]
----
Span span = tracer.buildSpan("doOperation").start();
try (Scope childScope = tracer.activateSpan(span)) {
    doOperation();
} finally {
    span.finish();
}
----

Corresponding code that uses the OpenTelemetry API is similar to the following example:


[source,java]
----
Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("doOperation").startSpan();
try (Scope childScope = span.makeCurrent()) {
    doOperation();
} finally {
    span.end();
}
----
