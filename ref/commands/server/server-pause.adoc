= server pause command

Pauses all or specific inbound work for an Open Liberty server.

By pausing and resuming inbound work, you can isolate resources for auditing or debugging without having to stop the server. You can pause all components or specific components:

* Pause HTTP endpoints to isolate one or more resources associated with an HTTP endpoint; for example, a database.
* Pause message-driven bean (MDB) message endpoints to prevent the endpoints from receiving messages.

== Usage examples

To pause all pausable components on the `myserver` server:

----
server pause myserver
----

To pause the `db1HttpEndpoint` and `db2HttpEndpoint` HTTP endpoints on the `myserver` server:

----
server pause myserver --target=db1HttpEndpoint,db2HttpEndpoint
----

To pause the `Bean` MDB message endpoint on the `myserver` server:

----
server pause myserver --target=MDBApplication#MDBModule.jar#Bean
----

To pause the `db1HttpEndpoint` HTTP endpoint and the `Bean` MDB message endpoint on the `myserver` server:

----
server pause myserver --target=db1HttpEndpoint,MDBApplication#MDBModule.jar#Bean
----

== Syntax

Run the command from the `/wlp/bin` directory.

----
server pause serverName [options]
----

serverName::
The name of the server with components that you want to pause. If the named server is not running or does not exist, the command fails. If no server name is specified, the command uses `defaultServer`.

options::
One or more optional parameters. If you do not specify any options, all pausable components on the server are paused.

== Options

|Option
|Description

|--target=http_endpoint,http_endpoint,...
|A comma-delimited list of HTTP endpoints to pause. Provide the ID of each HTTP endpoint as specified in the server configuration. For example, the following configuration shows two endpoint IDs, `db1HttpEndpoint` and `db2HttpEndpoint`, that you can specify for the `--target` option:

`<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="\*" httpPort="8800" httpsPort="8810"/>`

`<httpEndpoint id="db1HttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="8801" httpsPort="8811"/>`

`<httpEndpoint id="db2HttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="8802" httpsPort="8812"/>`

|--target=message_endpoint,message_endpoint,...

|A comma-delimited list of message endpoints to pause. Provide the activation name of each MDB message endpoint in the format: `ApplicationName#ModuleName#BeanName`.

== Exit codes

The following exit codes are available for the `server pause` command and the equivalent executable JAR file `ws-server.jar`:

0::
    OK. 0 indicates successful completion of the requested operation.
1::
    1 indicates that the JVM options that were used are not valid.
2::
    2 indicates that the server does not exist.
>=20::
    Exit codes greater than or equal to 20 indicate that an error occurred while performing the request. Messages are printed and captured in log files with more information about the error.
