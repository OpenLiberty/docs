== Usage examples

To force the `myserver` server to stop without the quiesce stage:
----
server stop myserver --force
----

To stop the `myserver` server with the quiesce stage:
----
server stop myserver --clean
----

== Syntax

Run the command from `path_to_liberty/bin`.

----
server stop serverName [options]
----

serverName::
The name of the server to run the command against. If a server is not specified on the command line, the action is performed against the default server instance, `defaultServer`, if it exists.
options::
One or more optional parameters.

== Options

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Option
|Description

|--clean
|Cleans all persistent cached information that is related to the specified server instance, which includes OSGi resolver metadata and persistent OSGi bundle data. If you use this option, the server will be required to recompute any cached data at the next startup, which might take more time than a restart that can reuse cached data.
|--force
| Skips the quiesce stage before the server is shut down.

Normal server stop includes a quiesce stage before the server is shut down. The quiesce stage, a period of 30 seconds, allows for services to perform pre-shutdown work, for example, stopping inbound listeners but allowing existing requests to complete.

The --force option has no effect if server stop was already invoked. If you use the --force option, you might see unexpected exceptions in the messages.log file that occur after the server stop command was received by the server.
