= server create command

Creates an Open Liberty server.

== Usage examples

Create a server called `myserver`:

----
server create myserver
----

== Syntax

Run the command from `path_to_liberty/bin`.

----
server create serverName
----

serverName::
A name for the server. If no server is specified, a server called `defaultServer` is automatically created.

Naming constraints:

* Use only Unicode alphanumeric (e.g. 0-9, a-z, A-Z), underscore (_), dash (-), plus (+), and period (.) characters.
* Do not begin the with a dash (-) or a period (.).
* Be aware that your file system, operating system, or compressed file directory might impose more restrictions.

When the server is created successfully, you receive the message: `Server server_name created`.

A directory with the name of the new server is created under the `${wlp.user.dir}/servers` directory, containing the configuration of the new server. The HTTP port numbers for the new server are assigned to default values and are shown in the generated `server.xml` file to make it easy to edit them.

If the specified server exists, then no server is created and you receive an exception message:

----
CWWKE0005E: The runtime environment could not be launched.
CWWKE0045E: It was not possible to create the server called server_name because
the server directory C:\wlp\usr\servers\server_name already exists.
