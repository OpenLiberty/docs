= server resume command

Resumes all or specific inbound work for an Open Liberty server.

By pausing and resuming inbound work, you can isolate resources for auditing or debugging purposes without having to stop the server. You can resume all components that were paused or specific components that were paused.

* link:#server-pause.html[Pause all or specific inbound work for an Open Liberty server.]

== Usage examples

You can resume all components that were paused or specific components that were paused.

To resume all components on the `myserver` server:

----
server resume myserver
----

To resume two specific components on the `myserver` server, where the values of `target1` and `target2` are components that can be paused for each supported protocol:

----
server resume myserver --target=target1,target2
----

To resume the `db1HttpEndpoint` and `db2HttpEndpoint` HTTP endpoints on the `myserver` server:

----
server resume myserver --target=db1HttpEndpoint,db2HttpEndpoint
----

To resume the `Bean` MDB message endpoint on the `myserver` server:

----
server resume myserver --target=MDBApplication#MDBModule.jar#Bean
----

To resume the `db1HttpEndpoint` HTTP endpoint and the `Bean` MDB message endpoint on the `myserver` server:

----
server resume myserver --target=db1HttpEndpoint,MDBApplication#MDBModule.jar#Bean
----

== Syntax

Run the command from `path_to_liberty/bin`.

----
server resume serverName [options]
----

serverName::
The name of the server to run the command against. If no server is specified, a server called `defaultServer` is automatically created to run the command against.

options::
One or more optional parameters. If you do not specify any endpoints, the entire server is resumed.

`<httpEndpoint id="db1HttpEndpoint" host="\*" httpPort="8801" httpsPort="8811"/>`

`<httpEndpoint id="db2HttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="8802" httpsPort="8812"/>`

|--target=message_endpoint,message_endpoint,...
