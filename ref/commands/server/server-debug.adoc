Starts the named Open Liberty server in debug mode.

Runs the named server in the console foreground after a debugger connects to the debug port. The standard output and error from the server process are output to the foreground.

== Usage examples

To start the `myserver` server in debug mode:

----
server debug myserver
----

== Syntax

Run the command from `path_to_liberty/bin`.

----
server package serverName
----

serverName::
The name of the server to run the command against. If no server is specified, a server called `defaultServer` is automatically created to run the command against.

The default port is `7777`. You can use the `${WLP_DEBUG_ADDRESS}` variable to specify an alternative port.

== Exit codes

The following exit codes are available for the `server debug` command and the equivalent executable JAR file `ws-server.jar`:

0::
    OK. 0 indicates successful completion of the requested operation.
1::
    1 indicates invocation of a redundant operation, such as starting a started server or stopping a stopper server. 1 might also be returned if the JVM options that were used are not valid.
2::
    2 indicates that the server does not exist.
>=20::
    Exit codes greater than or equal to 20 indicate that an error occurred while performing the request. Messages are printed and captured in log files with more information about the error.
