== Examples

You can require that users log in with a specific social media provider, or you can give them a list of providers so that they can choose which they prefer to log in with. You can also restrict when they have certain log in options based on browser type, the application, and so on. The following examples show how to configure different scenarios in your `server.xml`.

=== Request log in with a social media ID

If multiple social media providers are configured, a customizable selection form is presented.
Thus, the user can sign in with a social media provider of their choice.
The following example shows how to configure your application to request that the user logs in with their Google ID:

[source,xml]
----
<googleLogin clientId="your_app_id" clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />

<!-- protected apps need to have a security constraint defined -->
<application type="war" id="formlogin" name="formlogin" location="${server.config.dir}/apps/formlogin.war">
    <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="Employee">
            <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
        </security-role>
    </application-bnd>
</application>
----

=== Provide a choice of social media providers to the user

You can provide the user with a choice of social media providers on a form from which they choose one to log in with.
The following example presents the user with the choice of Google, GitHub, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter with which to log in:

[source,xml]
----
<googleLogin clientId="your_app_id" clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<githubLogin   clientid="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<facebookLogin clientId="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<linkedinLogin clientId="your_app_id"          clientSecret="your_app_secret"  />
<twitterLogin  consumerKey="your_app_id"       consumerSecret="your_app_secret"/>

<!-- protected apps need to have a security constraint defined -->
<application type="war" id="formlogin" name="formlogin" location="${server.config.dir}/apps/formlogin.war">
    <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="Employee">
            <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS" />
        </security-role>
    </application-bnd>
</application>
----

=== Request log in with a social media ID only if the user is also in another registry

You can restrict the presentation of a social media provider to only users who are also in another configured registry.
For example, use the `mapToUserRegistry` attribute to make sure the user exists in the user registry:

[source,xml]
----
 <googleLogin  mapToUserRegistry="true" clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret"   />

 <ldapRegistry ...> ... </ldapRegistry>

----

For more information on configuring an LDAP registry, see the LDAP User Registry (feature:ldapRegistry[]) feature.

=== Require authenticated users to also be present in the configured registry

You can give users the option of logging in with either a social media provider or with their account on the configured registry.
For example, use the `enableLocalAuthentication` attribute to configure your app so that users can have the option of logging in with a Google ID or with their account on their company's LDAP registry:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- user will be presented choice menu of either Google or ldap -->
<googleLogin  clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret" />

<socialLoginWebapp enableLocalAuthentication="true">

<ldapRegistry id="ldap" ...> ... </ldapRegistry>

----

=== Request log in with a social media ID for only a subset of applications, URLs, browsers, or IP addresses

To protect only a subset of applications, URLs, or IP addresses, use an link:https://docs/ref/general/#authentication-filters-specifying-mechanism.html[authentication filter].
The security configuration takes effect only when the conditions in the filter are met. For example,
you might want a web app to be secured with the Social Media Login feature and a microservice app to be secured with the link:https://docs/ref/feature/#mp-jwt.html[MicroProfile JWT] feature:


// tag::authfilter[]
[source,xml]
----
<!-- only requests with "/mywebapp" in them will be authenticated using Google. -->
<googleLogin  authFilterRef="authFilter1" clientId="your app id"  clientSecret="your app secret" />

<authFilter id="authFilter1">
    <requestUrl
        id="myUrlFilter"
        urlPattern="/mywebapp"
        matchType="contains" />
</authFilter>
----
// end::authfilter[]

For more information, see the link:https://docs/ref/config/#authFilter.html[`authFilter`] configuration element..

=== Provide other social media logins as options to the user

To authenticate with a social media provider that isn't configured out-of-the-box with Open Liberty, use the link:https://docs/ref/config/#oauth2Login.html[`oauth2Login`] element for OAuth providers or the link:https://docs/ref/config/#oidcLogin.html[`oidcLogin`] element for OpenID Connect providers.
These elements supply the configuration details that are needed to work with the provider.
The details can usually be obtained from the developer instructions of the social media provider.
The following example configures Instagram as the social media provider::

[source,xml]
----
<oauth2Login id="instagramLogin" clientId="client_id" clientSecret="client_secret"
    scope="basic public_content"   responseType="code"
    tokenEndpointAuthMethod="client_secret_post"
    authorizationEndpoint="https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize"
    tokenEndpoint="https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token"
    userApi="https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self"
    userNameAttribute="username"
    website="https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/">
</oauth2Login>
----

The `socialLogin-1.0` feature can be configured to use OpenShift service accounts to authenticate and authorize protected resource requests.
This configuration allows server administrators to secure endpoints, for example, monitoring and metrics endpoints that might produce sensitive information but require repeated access by an automated process or non-human entity.
Thus, the service accounts can authenticate themselves by providing a service account token that was created within the OpenShift cluster in the request.

To configure the `socialLogin-1.0` feature ,specify the `okdServiceLogin` element.

[source,xml]
----
<server>

<featureManager>
  <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<okdServiceLogin />

</server>
----

The configuration assumes that the Liberty server is packaged and deployed within an OpenShift cluster.
By default, the `okdServiceLogin` element is used to authenticate all protected resource requests that the Liberty server receives.

Incoming requests to protected resources must include a service account token.
The token must be specified as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header of the request.
The Liberty server uses the service account token to query information about the associated service account from the OpenShift cluster.
The OpenShift project is used as the group for the service account for authorization decisions.
Similarly, the name of the service account is used as the username.

If the Liberty server is not deployed within an OpenShift cluster, the `userValidationApi` attribute must be configured to the value of the appropriate User API endpoint in the OpenShift cluster:

`<okdServiceLogin userValidationApi="https://cluster.domain.example.com/apis/user.openshift.io/v1/users/~" />`

Multiple `okdServiceLogin` elements can be configured if each element has a unique `id` attribute.
In those cases, authentication filters must also be configured so that appropriate endpoints are protected by a unique `okdServiceLogin` instance.
