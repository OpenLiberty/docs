The `samlWebSso20` element is configured by default in Liberty.

----
<samlWebSso20 id="defaultSP">

</samlWebSso20>
----

The default configuration sets the following values:

- AssertionConsumerService URL:

`https://<hostname>:<sslport>/ibm/saml20/defaultSP/acs`

- Service Provider (SP) metadata URL:

`https://<hostname>:<sslport>/ibm/saml20/defaultSP/samlmetadata`

The preferred approach to configure SAML is by using metadata exchange.
Supply the provided URL to the SAML identity provider (IdP) to establish federation between this SP and IdP.
If the IdP requires a file instead of a URL, use a browser to retrieve the data from that URL and supply the file.
Next, obtain the metadata file from the provider, rename it to `idpMetadata.xml`, and copy it to the `resources/security` directory on the server.
The issuer name for SAML assertion is used as the security realm, and `NameID` element is used as the princIdPal to create an authenticated subject from the SAML assertion.

The SAML `AuthnRequest` request is signed with a private key in the default keystore of the server if the `KeyStoreRef` attribute is not specified.
If the `keyAlias` element is not configured, then `samlsp` element is the default key alias.
If the `keyAlias` element is not configured, and the keystore contains only one private key, the private key is used in the signature.

If you create a new service provider instance and the `defaultSP` instance is no longer required, then you must explicitly disable the `defaultSP` instance.
You can disable the `defaultSP` instance by adding the following code to the `server.xml` file:

----
<samlWebSso20 id="defaultSP" enabled="false">
</samlWebSso20>
----

Additional attributes can be optionally specified to override the default behavior. In most cases, exchange of the metadata files is sufficient.
