=== Basic user registry configuration
You can configure Open Liberty to authenticate and authorize users by using a basic user registry. The basic user registry contains user account details that are used by applications to perform security-related tasks. To configure a basic user registry, the Application Security feature must be enabled in the `server.xml` file. The following example shows the configuration of a basic user registry:
[source,xml]
----
<basicRegistry id="basic" realm="WebRealm">
   <user name="Bob" password="bobpwd" />
            <user name="John" password="johnpwd" />
</basicRegistry>Copy
----

To configure a basic user registry with multiple users, you can create groups for users with unique group names as shown in the following example:
[source,xml]
----
<basicRegistry id="basic" realm="WebRealm">
	  <user name="Bob" password="bobpwd" />
         <user name="John" password="johnpwd" />
	   <user name="user1" password="user1pwd" />
         <user name="user2" password="user2pwd" />

       <group name="myAdmins">
          <member name="Bob" />
          <member name="user1" />
       </group>

       <group name="users">
          <member name="user1" />
          <member name="user2" />
       </group>
</basicRegistry>
----

=== QuickStart security configuration
When you are configuring the basic user registry, you can configure role mapping in the `server.xml` file by using the `<quickStartSecurity>` element. If the user or group of users in the basic user registry is used to perform application management activities, the administrative role can be granted to the user or group by default when you use the `<quickStartSecurity>` element. The following example shows the configuration to define the username and password that is granted to the `Administrator` with the `<quickStartSecurity>` element:
[source,xml]
----
<quickStartSecurity userName="Bob" userPassword="bobpwd" />
----

=== LTPA configuration
When the Application Security feature is enabled, Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) is enabled by default. The following example shows the configuration of the `<ltpa>` element in the `server.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
<ltpa keysFileName="yourLTPAKeysFileName.keys" keysPassword="keysPassword" expiration="120"
----

LTPA configuration can provide Single Sign-on (SSO) to secure applications. For more information, see https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/general/#sso-config-ltpa.html[SSO configuration with LTPA cookies].
