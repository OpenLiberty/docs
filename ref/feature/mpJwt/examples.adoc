=== Basic configuration to implement MicroProfile JWT

The following example shows that the service requires requests to be authenticated using JWTs.
The `mpJwt` element defines the use of JWT token from the OIDC client and the `keyStore` element defines the keystore that will be used by the JWT:

[source,xml]
----
    <mpJwt id="mympjwt" issuer="https://example.com"
        jwksUri="https://localhost:19443/jwt/ibm/api/myBuilder/jwk"/>

    <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keyspass"/>
----

=== Specify login with MicroProfile JSON Web Token for only a subset of applications, URLs, browsers, or IP addresses

To protect only a subset of applications, URLs, or IP addresses, use an authentication filter. The security configuration takes effect only when the conditions in the filter are met.
In the following example, requests to the myApp application are authorized using JWT:

[source,xml]
----
<mp-jwt authFilterRef="authFilter1" />
<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
         <webApp id="myWebApp"
         name="myApp"
         matchType="contains"/>
</authFilter>
----
