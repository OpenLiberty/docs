=== Basic configuration to implement MicroProfile JWT

The following example shows that the service requires requests to be authenticated using JWTs.
The `mpJwt` element defines configuration for processing inbound JWT tokens.  The `JwksUri` attribute tells the `mpjwt` element where to obtain the public key from to validate the JWT. 
The `keystore` element defines the key and trust store where, when JWKS is not used, the public key is held to validate the JWT:
[source,xml]
----
    <mpJwt id="mympjwt" issuer="https://example.com"
        jwksUri="https://localhost:19443/jwt/ibm/api/myBuilder/jwk"/>

    <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keyspass"/>
----

=== Specify login with MicroProfile JSON Web Token for only a subset of applications, URLs, browsers, or IP addresses

To protect only a subset of applications, URLs, or IP addresses, use an authentication filter. The security configuration takes effect only when the conditions in the filter are met.
In the following example, requests to the myApp application are authorized using JWT:

[source,xml]
----
<mp-jwt authFilterRef="authFilter1" />
<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
         <webApp id="myWebApp"
         name="myApp"
         matchType="contains"/>
</authFilter>
----
