=== Configure Liberty servers to persist session data with JCache provider

Following is an example to configure session persistence by using Hazelcast as the JCache provider:


[source,java]
----

  <library id="jCacheVendorLib">
    <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/hazelcast" includes="hazelcast.jar"/>
  </library>

  <httpSessionCache libraryRef="jCacheVendorLib"
                    uri="file:${server.config.dir}/hazelcast/hazelcast.xml"/>

----

The `library` element defines a library that points to the location of your JCache provider.
The JCache provider in this example is Hazelcast, which is located in the `hazelcast.jar` directory.
Additional Hazelcast configuration is provided in the `hazelcast.xml` file.
