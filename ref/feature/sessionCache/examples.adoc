=== Minimum configuration to persist session data with Hazelcast as the JCache provider

The following example shows the configuration of session persistence by using Hazelcast as the JCache provider:

[source,java]
----

<library id="jCacheVendorLib">
  <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/hazelcast" includes="hazelcast.jar"/>
</library>

<httpSessionCache libraryRef="jCacheVendorLib"
                  uri="file:${server.config.dir}/hazelcast/hazelcast.xml"/>

----

The `library` element defines a library that points to the location of your JCache provider.
The JCache provider in this example is Hazelcast, which is located in the `hazelcast.jar` library.
Additional Hazelcast configuration is provided in the `hazelcast.xml` file.
