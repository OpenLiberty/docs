The Audit feature introduces an infrastructure that serves two purposes:
 - Confirming the effectiveness and integrity of the existing configuration
 - Identifying areas where improvement to the configuration may be needed

The Audit feature can capture a range of auditable events, including
events related to authentication, authorization, and logout. The feature provides a default implementation, the AuditFileHandler, which emits human-readable audit records to a file-based log. Each audit record is emitted in JSON format.
