Microprofile Metrics provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.
When the application runs, you can view your metrics from any browser by visiting the endpoint.

The MicroProfile Metrics feature also can provide access to metrics about server components when it is used in combination with the https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/feature/#monitor-1.0.html[monitor-1.0 feature].
