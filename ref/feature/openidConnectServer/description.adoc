Single sign-on (SSO) is a process to sign in once with your credentials to access multiple applications.
Open Liberty offers several features that enable SSO. One of those features is OpenID Connect (OIDC).
OpenID Connect is a protocol that helps developers authenticate users without the need to manage user credentials.
You can configure Open Liberty to act as an OpenID Connect provider.
With this configuration, users need to authenticate once to access Open Liberty resources such as HTML, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and servlets.
Users can also access resources in multiple Open Liberty servers that share Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) keys.
