+Configuration for the SIP endpoint+

[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]
|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+bindRetries+

|int

|+60+

|+The number of retries that are attempted when port binding is unsuccessful.+

|+bindRetryDelay+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+5000ms+

|+The delay between retries in milliseconds. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+host+

|string

|+localhost+

|+The IP of the endpoint host+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+sipTCPPort+

|int

|+5060+

|+The TCP port used by the SIP endpoint. Use -1 to disable this port.+

|+sipTLSPort+

|int

|+5061+

|+The TLS port used by the SIP endpoint. Use -1 to disable this port.+

|+sipUDPPort+

|int

|+5060+

|+The UDP port used by the SIP endpoint. Use -1 to disable this port.+

|+sslOptionsRef+

|A reference to top level sslOptions element (string).

|

|+Defines SSL protocol settings+

|+tcpOptionsRef+

|A reference to top level tcpOptions element (string).

|+defaultTCPOptions+

|+Defines TCP protocol settings+
|===
[#+sslOptions+]*sslOptions*

+Defines SSL protocol settings+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+sessionTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+1d+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+sslRef+

|A reference to top level ssl element (string).

|

|+The default SSL configuration repertoire. The default value is defaultSSLSettings.+

|+sslSessionTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+8640ms+

|+The timeout limit for an SSL session that is established by the SSL Channel. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+suppressHandshakeErrors+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Disable logging of SSL handshake errors. SSL handshake errors can occur during normal operation, however these messages can be useful when SSL is behaving unexpectedly.+

[#+tcpOptions+]*tcpOptions*

+Defines TCP protocol settings+


[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+acceptThread+

|boolean

|+false+

|+If true, then listening ports do not share the same thread for accepting connections. Otherwise, they share the same thread.+

|+addressExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+addressIncludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+hostNameExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+hostNameIncludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+inactivityTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+maxOpenConnections+

|int

|+128000+

|+Defines the maximum number of connections allowed to be open on this endpoint.+

|+portOpenRetries+

|int +
Min: +0+ +
Max: +100000+

|+0+

|+Number of retries to open a TCP/IP port during server startup.  There will be a one second delay between retries, until the opening is successful or the port open retry number is reached.+

|+soReuseAddr+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables immediate rebind to a port with no active listener.+

|+waitToAccept+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Queries whether this TCP Channel will delay accepting connections until the server starts. If false, connections are closed until the server starts. If true, the value for the acceptThread tcpOption is also set to true, and connections are delayed until the server starts.+
