|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+clientAuthentication+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether client authentication is enabled. If set to true then client authentication is required and the client must provide a certificate for the server trusts.+

|+clientAuthenticationSupported+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether a client authentication is supported.  If set to true then the client authentication support means the server will check trust from a client if the client presents a certificate.+

|+clientKeyAlias+

|string

|

|+Specifies the alias of the certificate in the keystore that is used as the key to send to a server that has client authentication enabled.  This attribute is only needed if the keystore has more than one key entry.+

|+enabledCiphers+

|string

|

|+Specifies a custom list of ciphers. Separate each cipher in the list with a space. The supported cipher will depend on the underlying JRE used.  Please check the JRE for valid ciphers.+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+keyStoreRef+

|A reference to top level keyStore element (string).

|

|+A keystore containing key entries for the SSL repertoire. This attribute is required.+

|+securityLevel+

|* +CUSTOM+
* +HIGH+
* +LOW+
* +MEDIUM+


|+HIGH+

|+Specifies the cipher suite group used by the SSL handshake.  HIGH are 3DES and 128 bit and higher ciphers, MEDIUM are DES and 40 bit ciphers, LOW are ciphers without encryption.  If the enabledCiphers attribute is used the securityLevel list is ignored.+ +
*+CUSTOM+* +
+%repertoire.CUSTOM+ +
*+HIGH+* +
+Cipher suites 3DES and 128 bit and higher+ +
*+LOW+* +
+%repertoire.LOW+ +
*+MEDIUM+* +
+%repertoire.MEDIUM+

|+serverKeyAlias+

|string

|

|+Specifies the alias of the certificate in the keystore used as the server's key.  This attribute is only needed if the keystore has more then one key entry.+

|+sslProtocol+

|string

|

|+The SSL handshake protocol. Protocol values can be found in the documentation for the underlying JRE's Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) provider.  When using the IBM JRE the default value is SSL_TLS and when using the Oracle JRE the default value is SSL.+

|+trustStoreRef+

|A reference to top level keyStore element (string).

|

|+A keystore containing trusted certificate entries used by the SSL repertoire for signing verification. This attribute is optional. If unspecified, the same keystore is used for both key and trusted certificate entries.+
|===
[#+keyStore+]*keyStore*

+A keystore containing key entries for the SSL repertoire. This attribute is required.+


[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]
|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+fileBased+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specify true if the keystore is file based and false if the keystore is a SAF keyring or hardware keystore type.+

|+id+

|string

|+defaultKeyStore+

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+location+

|A file, directory or url.

|+${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.jks+

|+An absolute or relative path to the keystore file. If a relative path is provided, the server will attempt to locate the file in the ${server.output.dir}/resources/security directory. Use the keystore file for a file-based keystore, the keyring name for SAF keyrings, or the device configuration file for hardware cryptography devices. In the SSL minimal configuration, the location of the file is assumed to be ${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.jks.+

|+password+

|Reversably encoded password (string)

|

|+The password used to load the keystore file. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. Use the securityUtility tool to encode the password.+

|+pollingRate+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+500ms+

|+Rate at which the server checks for updates to a keystore file. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+readOnly+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specify true if the keystore is to be used by the server for reading and false if write operations will be performed by the server on the keystore.+

|+type+

|string

|+jks+

|+A keystore type supported by the target SDK.+

|+updateTrigger+

|* +disabled+
* +mbean+
* +polled+


|+mbean+

|+Keystore file update method or trigger.+ +
*+disabled+* +
+Disables all update monitoring. Changes to the keystore file will not be applied while the server is running.+ +
*+mbean+* +
+Server will only update the keystore when prompted by the FileNotificationMbean. The FileNotificationMbean is typically called by an external program such as an integrated development environment or a management application.+ +
*+polled+* +
+Server will scan for keystore file changes at the polling interval and update if the keystore file has detectable changes.+
