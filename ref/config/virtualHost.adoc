|string

|+false+

|+Prevents the HTTP Channel from sending multiple Set-Cookie headers with the same name.+

Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
