|string

|+false+

|+Prevents the HTTP Channel from sending multiple Set-Cookie headers with the same name.+

|+MessageSizeLimit+

|long

|+-1+

|+Limits the acceptable size of an incoming message. If a message arrives with a size larger than this value, then an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+NoCacheCookiesControl+

|boolean
