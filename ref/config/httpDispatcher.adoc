[#+trustedHeaderOrigin+]*trustedHeaderOrigin*

+Private headers are used by the web server plug-in to provide information about the original request. These headers take precedence over the http Host header, and are used to select a virtual host to service a request. The default value is '*', which will trust incoming private headers from any source. Specify 'none' to disable private headers and rely only on the http Host header, or specify a list of IP addresses to restrict private header processing to specific trusted sources.+


[#+trustedSensitiveHeaderOrigin+]*trustedSensitiveHeaderOrigin*

+Private headers are used by the web server plug-in to provide information about the original request. A subset of these headers are considered sensitive. By default, the value for this property is 'none'. Incoming, sensitive private headers are not trusted from any source. Specify a comma-separated list of IP addresses, such as {1.1.2.2, F:FF:FFF:FFFF:1:11:111:1111} to allow sensitive private header processing for specific trusted sources, or specify '*' to trust incoming sensitive private headers from any source.+
