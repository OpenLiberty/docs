|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+AutoDecompression+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether the HTTP Channel automatically decompresses incoming request body data.+

|+DoNotAllowDuplicateSetCookies+

|string

|+false+

|+Prevents the HTTP Channel from sending multiple Set-Cookie headers with the same name.+

|+MessageSizeLimit+

|long

|+-1+

|+Limits the acceptable size of an incoming message. If a message arrives with a size larger than this value, then an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+NoCacheCookiesControl+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Allows the user to control whether or not the presence of a Set-Cookie header should update the Cache-Control header with a matching no-cache value. This also adds the Expires header.+

|+http2ConnectionIdleTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+0+

|+Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that an HTTP/2 connection will be allowed to remain idle between socket IO operations. If not specified, or set to a value of 0, there is no connection timeout set. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+incomingBodyBufferSize+

|int +
Min: +1024+ +
 +
Max: +1048576+ +


|+32768+

|+Specifies the size of each buffer used when reading the body of an incoming HTTP message.+

|+keepAliveEnabled+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables persistent connections (HTTP keepalive). If true, connections are kept alive for reuse by multiple sequential requests and responses. If false, connections are closed after the response is sent.+

|+limitFieldSize+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
 +
Max: +32768+ +


|+32768+

|+Enforces the size limits on various HTTP fields, such as request URLs, or individual header names or values. Enforcing the size limits of these fields guards against possible Denial of Service attacks. An error is returned to the remote client, if a field exceeds the allowed size.+

|+limitNumHeaders+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
 +
Max: +500+ +


|+500+

|+Limits the number of HTTP headers that can exist in an incoming message. When this limit is exceeded, an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+maxConcurrentStreams+

|int

|+200+

|+Specifies the maximum number of streams that an HTTP/2 connection can have active at any given point. Opening streams over the limit, will result on a REFUSED_STREAM (0x7). If not specified, the default value of concurrent streams will be set to 200.+

|+maxFrameSize+

|int +
Min: +16384+ +
 +
Max: +16777215+ +


|+57344+

|+Specifies the maximum allowed size of a frame payload the server will advertise in the SETTINGS_MAS_FRAME_SIZE HTTP/2 settings frame. This can be configured to any size within the range of 16,384 to 16,777,215 bytes, inclusive. If not specified, the default is set to 57,344 bytes.+

|+maxKeepAliveRequests+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +


|+100+

|+Maximum number of persistent requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection if persistent connections are enabled. A value of -1 means unlimited.+

|+persistTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+Amount of time that a socket will be allowed to remain idle between requests. This setting only applies if persistent connections are enabled. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+readTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read request to complete on a socket after the first read occurs. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+removeServerHeader+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Removes server implementation information from HTTP headers and also disables the default Liberty profile welcome page.+

|+writeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait on a socket for each portion of the response data to be transmitted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
