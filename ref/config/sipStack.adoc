|+acceptNonUtf8Bytes+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Accept byte sequences that are not encoded in UTF-8.+

|+auto100OnInvite+

|boolean

|+true+

|+The SIP container automatically sends a 100 response code when an INVITE request is received.+

* +Always+
* +MtuExceeds+
* +Never+

|+Defines when the SIP stack uses compact headers when encoding a message.+ +
*+API+* +
+Headers are sent according to JSR289 javax.servlet.sip.SipServletMessage.setHeaderForm(javax.servlet.sip.SipServletMessage.HeaderForm)+ +
*+Always+* +
+Headers are always sent in compact form+ +
