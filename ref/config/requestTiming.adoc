|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+hungRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+10m+

|+Duration of time that a request can run before being considered hung. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+includeContextInfo+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Indicates if the context information details are included in the log output.+

|+interruptHungRequests+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether a request that is hung is to be interrupted. A value of true causes the requestTiming-1.0 feature to attempt to interrupt the hung request. A value of false allows the request to continue to run.+

|+sampleRate+

|int +
Min: +1+

|+1+

|+Rate at which the sampling should happen for the slow request tracking.  To sample one out of every n requests, set sampleRate to n.  To sample all requests, set sampleRate to 1.+

|+slowRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+10s+

|+Duration of time that a request can run before being considered slow. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

[#+jdbcTiming+]*jdbcTiming*

+Overrides defaults that are specified in the root attributes of requestTiming for JDBC requests.+


[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+dataSourceName+

|string

|

|+The name of the datasource that is being monitored. The datasource name is provided by the context information in the eventLogging-1.0 service. If this attribute is not provided, all datasource names are monitored.+

|+hungRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|

|+Duration of time that a JDBC request can run before being considered hung. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+interruptHungRequests+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether a JDBC request that is hung is to be interrupted. A value of true causes the requestTiming-1.0 feature to attempt to interrupt the hung request. A value of false allows the request to continue to run.+

|+query+

|string

|

|+The SQL statement that is being monitored. The SQL statement is provided by the context information in the eventLogging-1.0 service. If this attribute is not provided, all SQL statements are monitored.+

|+slowRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|

|+Duration of time that a JDBC request can run before being considered slow. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

[#+servletTiming+]*servletTiming*

+Overrides defaults that are specified in the root attributes of requestTiming for servlet requests.+


[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]
|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+appName+

|string

|

|+The name of the application that is being monitored. The application name is provided by the context information in the eventLogging-1.0 service. If this attribute is not provided, all applications are monitored.+

|+hungRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|

|+Duration of time that a servlet request can run before being considered hung. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+interruptHungRequests+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether a servlet request that is hung is to be interrupted. A value of true causes the requestTiming-1.0 feature to attempt to interrupt the hung request. A value of false allows the request to continue to run.+

|+servletName+

|string

|

|+The name of the servlet that is being monitored. The servlet name is provided by the context information in the eventLogging-1.0 service. If this attribute is not provided, all servlets are monitored.+

|+slowRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|

|+Duration of time that a servlet request can run before being considered slow. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms.
