|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+hungRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+10m+

|+Duration of time that a request can run before being considered hung. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+includeContextInfo+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Indicates if the context information details are included in the log output.+

|+interruptHungRequests+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether a request that is hung is to be interrupted. A value of true causes the requestTiming-1.0 feature to attempt to interrupt the hung request. A value of false allows the request to continue to run.+

|+sampleRate+

|int +
Min: +1+ +


|+1+

|+Rate at which the sampling should happen for the slow request tracking.  To sample one out of every n requests, set sampleRate to n.  To sample all requests, set sampleRate to 1.+

|+slowRequestThreshold+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+10s+

|+Duration of time that a request can run before being considered slow. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+
