|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+AutoDecompression+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether the HTTP Channel automatically decompresses incoming request body data.+

|+DoNotAllowDuplicateSetCookies+

|string

|+false+

|+Prevents the HTTP Channel from sending multiple Set-Cookie headers with the same name.+

|+MessageSizeLimit+

|long

|+-1+

|+Limits the acceptable size of an incoming message. If a message arrives with a size larger than this value, then an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+NoCacheCookiesControl+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Allows the user to control whether or not the presence of a Set-Cookie header should update the Cache-Control header with a matching no-cache value. This also adds the Expires header.+

|+http2ConnectionIdleTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+0+

|+Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that an HTTP/2 connection will be allowed to remain idle between socket IO operations. If not specified, or set to a value of 0, there is no connection timeout set. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+incomingBodyBufferSize+

|int +
Min: +1024+ +
 +
Max: +1048576+ +


|+32768+

|+Specifies the size of each buffer used when reading the body of an incoming HTTP message.+

|+keepAliveEnabled+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables persistent connections (HTTP keepalive). If true, connections are kept alive for reuse by multiple sequential requests and responses. If false, connections are closed after the response is sent.+

|+limitFieldSize+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
 +
Max: +32768+ +


|+32768+

|+Enforces the size limits on various HTTP fields, such as request URLs, or individual header names or values. Enforcing the size limits of these fields guards against possible Denial of Service attacks. An error is returned to the remote client, if a field exceeds the allowed size.+

|+limitNumHeaders+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
 +
Max: +500+ +


|+500+

|+Limits the number of HTTP headers that can exist in an incoming message. When this limit is exceeded, an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+maxConcurrentStreams+

|int

|+200+

|+Specifies the maximum number of streams that an HTTP/2 connection can have active at any given point. Opening streams over the limit, will result on a REFUSED_STREAM (0x7). If not specified, the default value of concurrent streams will be set to 200.+

|+maxFrameSize+

|int +
Min: +16384+ +
 +
Max: +16777215+ +


|+57344+

|+Specifies the maximum allowed size of a frame payload the server will advertise in the SETTINGS_MAS_FRAME_SIZE HTTP/2 settings frame. This can be configured to any size within the range of 16,384 to 16,777,215 bytes, inclusive. If not specified, the default is set to 57,344 bytes.+

|+maxKeepAliveRequests+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +


|+100+

|+Maximum number of persistent requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection if persistent connections are enabled. A value of -1 means unlimited.+

|+persistTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+Amount of time that a socket will be allowed to remain idle between requests. This setting only applies if persistent connections are enabled. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+readTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read request to complete on a socket after the first read occurs. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+removeServerHeader+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Removes server implementation information from HTTP headers and also disables the default Liberty profile welcome page.+

|+writeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait on a socket for each portion of the response data to be transmitted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+sessionTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+1d+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+sslRef+

|A reference to top level ssl element (string).

|

|+The default SSL configuration repertoire. The default value is defaultSSLSettings.+

|+sslSessionTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+8640ms+

|+The timeout limit for an SSL session that is established by the SSL Channel. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+suppressHandshakeErrors+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Disable logging of SSL handshake errors. SSL handshake errors can occur during normal operation, however these messages can be useful when SSL is behaving unexpectedly.+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+acceptThread+

|boolean

|+false+

|+If true, then listening ports do not share the same thread for accepting connections. Otherwise, they share the same thread.+

|+addressExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+addressIncludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+hostNameExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+hostNameIncludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+inactivityTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+soReuseAddr+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables immediate rebind to a port with no active listener.+

|+waitToAccept+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Queries whether this TCP Channel will delay accepting connections until the server starts. If false, connections are closed until the server starts. If true, the value for the acceptThread tcpOption is also set to true, and connections are delayed until the server starts.+
