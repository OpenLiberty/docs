= OpenAPI documentation for microservices

OpenAPI is a standardized mechanism to describe REST APIs. The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification is an official set of annotations and interfaces to help developers generate OpenAPI documentation for Java RESTful APIs.

You can generate the OpenAPI document in multiple ways.

== Annotations

MP OpenAPI processes JAX-RS annotations by default. You can augment the existing code with OpenAPI annotations, which provide detailed documentation for the REST API.

Vendors must process the relevant JAX-RS annotations like @Path, @Consumes, and Java objects used as input or output to JAX-RS operations. Developers can deploy the existing JAX-RS application into an MP OpenAPI vendor and check out the output from `/openapi`.

Annotations like @Callback, @Components, @ParameterIn, and more are found in the Eclipse OpenAPI annotations package. For an overview of annotation, see https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.0/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_quick_overview_of_annotations.

When the same annotation is used on a class and a method, the values from the method instance take precedence for that particular method, for example, @Server and @Tag annotations. The annotation values from the methodâ€™s parameters take precedence over corresponding annotation values from that method, for example, @Parameter and @RequestBody. The @Schema annotation has a complex set of possible combinations, and can be placed on POJOs and referenced from several other annotations.

For examples of annotations, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/wiki/Annotation-Samples[Annotation Samples]

== Static OpenAPI files

Take the initial output from `/openapi` as a starting point to document APIs with Static OpenAPI files. You can write the static files before any code. Enterprises often adopt this approach to lock-in the API contract. The client and provider must abide by this OpenAPI document, referred to as the "source of truth".

You can use a static OpenAPI file in YAML format or JSON format.

For examples of Static OpenAPI files, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/wiki/Static-File-Samples[Static File Samples].

== Programming model

You can provide OpenAPI elements with Java POJOs. For a complete set of models see, link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/annotations[org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models] package.

Use link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFactory.java[OASFactory] to create the elements of an OpenAPI tree, and the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASModelReader.java[OASModelReader] interface to bootstrap the OpenAPI model tree used by the processing framework.

For examples of OASModelReader, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/wiki/OASModelReader-Samples[OASModelReader Samples].

== Filter

With link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFilter.java[OASFilter], you can receive callbacks for various key OpenAPI elements. To use OASFilter, create an implementation of the interface and register it using the `mp.openapi.filter` configuration key, where the value is the fully qualified name of the filter class.

For examples of OASFilter, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/wiki/OASFilter-Samples[OASFilter Samples].

== OpenAPI UI

The native OpenAPI UI from Open Liberty is built from the open source link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[Swagger UI] and renders the generated `/openapi` document into a user friendly page. It can `Try out` each endpoint, making an invocation to the backend from the UI.

You can also link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSD28V_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/twlp_api_mpopenapi_custom.html[customize] the UI available from the endpoint `/openapi/ui`.
