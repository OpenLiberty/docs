= Forwarding logs and events to Logstash with Logstash collector

You can collect logs and events from your Open Liberty server and display them in a dashboard for analysis and troubleshooting purposes.
link:/docs/ref/feature/#logstashCollector-1.0.html[The Logstash collector feature] collects logs from Open Liberty and sends them to a remote Logstash server, where they can be managed and visualized by products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.

== About this task

Logstash is an open source log management tool that prepares log data for analysis. Logstash can ingest and transform data, and then send it to various outputs, such as Elasticsearch, Kafka, PagerDuty, or an email server. You can use the Open Liberty Logstash collector feature to send your log data to a Logstash server. Although this feature can send log data for analysis by any of the available output plug-ins from Logstash, many users choose to use Logstash with Elasticsearch and Kibana. Together, these three tools comprise the Elastic stack, a widely used open source platform to collect, manage, and build dashboards for log data. For more information, see link:https://www.elastic.co/downloads/[the Elastic website].

The `logstashCollector-1.0` feature was tested with the following products:

- Logstash V5.3.x, Elasticsearch V5.3.x, and Kibana V5.3.x
- Logstash V6.4.x, Elasticsearch V6.4.x, and Kibana V6.4.x
- Logstash V7.x, Elasticsearch V7.x, and Kibana V7.x

The Logstash Collector feature can collect and prepare data for analysis by any of link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plug-ins.html[the available Logstash output plug-ins]. The following procedure demonstrates how to collect your Open Liberty log data with the Logstash Collector feature, send it to a Logstash server, and view it in a Kibana dashboard.

== Before you begin

To configure the Elastic stack, set up link:https://www.elastic.co/logstash[Logstash], link:https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/[Elasticsearch], and link:https://www.elastic.co/kibana[Kibana] by following link:https://www.elastic.co[the instructions from Elastic].

== Procedure

. Create or acquire certificate and key pair files to enable SSL or TLS connections for Logstash. +
The following example command for link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] generates a certificate and key pair. Customize the number of days that the keys are valid as needed.
+
[role,command]
----
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash.key -out logstash.crt -days 365 -nodes
----

. Download a sample Logstash configuration file and an index template file from link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.logstash.collector[Sample Logstash Collector dashboards for Liberty].

.. Download the `liberty_logstash.conf` Logstash configuration file and the `liberty_logstash_template.json` index template file from the directory that corresponds to your Elastic version.

.. In the `liberty_logstash.conf` file, customize the Beats `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_key` paths with the certificate and key pair files you generated in step 1. Customize the `Elasticsearch_host_name:port_number` Elasticsearch hosts value with the host name and port number from your Elasticsearch configuration.

. Complete the following steps for each Open Liberty server from which you want to collect events:

.. Acquire or create a keystore for the Open Liberty server. To create a self-signed certificate, use the following command. Customize the server name, password, and subject as needed.
+
[role,command]
----
d:\wlp\bin\securityUtility createSSLCertificate --server=myServerName --password="Liberty" --subject=CN=myHostname,OU=defaultServer,O=ibm,C=us
----

.. Import the `logstash.crt` file that you created in step 1 into the `trust.jks` file in your server. Customize the `wlp_install_dir` directory and server name as needed. When prompted for a password, use the certificate password that you specified in step 3a.
+
[role,command]
----
d:\java\bin\keytool -import -noprompt -alias logstash -file logstash.crt -keystore wlp_install_dir\usr\servers\myServerName\resources\security\trust.jks -storepass Liberty
----

.. link:/docs/ref/feature/#logstashCollector-1.0.html[Configure the Logstash collector feature] in your `server.xml` file.

.. Enable link:https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/general/#access-logging.html[HTTP access logging].

. Start Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. See link:https://www.elastic.co/[the Elastic website] for instructions.

. Start the Open Liberty server and generate some events.

. Open Kibana in a browser and create an index.

- For Kibana 7, 6, or 5.6, click **Management** > **Index Patterns**.
** Enter `logstash-*` as the **Index Pattern**.
** Click **Advanced Options** and enter `logstash-*` as the **Index Pattern ID**.
** Select `datetime` as the **Time filter field name**, and click **Create**.

- For Kibana 5.0 - 5.5, click **Management** > **Index Patterns** and select `datetime` as the **Time filter field name**. Click **Create**.


. Download a sample dashboard from the directory that corresponds to your version of Elastic  in the link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.logstash.collector[Sample Logstash Collector dashboards for Liberty] repository.

. Import the dashboard into Kibana.

- Click **Management** > **Saved Object** > **Import** and select the dashboard that you downloaded in step 7.

. View the dashboard.

- Click **Dashboard** > **Open** and select the dashboard that you imported in step 8.

== Results

You configured your Open Liberty servers to send events to your Logstash server and can now view your events in the Liberty dashboard by using Kibana.
