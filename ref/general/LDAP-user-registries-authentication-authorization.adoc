= LDAP user registries for authentication and authorization

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open protocol that supports authentication and authorization services. LDAP specifies the language that application servers use to communicate with LDAP user registries, which store security information such as usernames, passwords, and user groups.

Although a link:/docs/ref/general/#basic-user-registries-application-development.html[basic user registry] might be sufficient during development and testing of an application, an LDAP user registry provides the extra security that is required for applications in production.
Many kinds of LDAP servers exist, such as the IBM Security Directory Server and the Microsoft Active Directory.
Open source LDAP servers are also available, such as OpenLDAP and ApacheDS.

== LDAP registry configuration

To configure Open Liberty to manage authentication with an LDAP user registry, add the link:/docs/ref/feature/#appSecurity-3.0.html[Application Security] and link:/docs/ref/feature/#ldapRegistry-3.0.html features to your `server.xml` file.
If you need to communicate with a TLS-enabled LDAP server, you must also add the link:/docs/ref/feature/#transportSecurity-1.0.html[Transport Security] feature.
For configuration examples, see link:/docs/ref/feature/#ldapRegistry-3.0.html[the LDAP User Registry feature].

== Federated LDAP registries

You can combine multiple LDAP registries into a federated registry.
In cases where user and group information is spread across multiple registries, federation enables Open Liberty to use distributed user information in a unified manner, with a continuous store of information.
Different types of registries can be federated to combine information from LDAP, basic, and custom user registries and repositories into a common registry. However, user registries that are configured with the `quickStartSecurity` element cannot be federated with other registries.

LDAP registries are federated by default.
If you configure more than one LDAP registry in your `server.xml` file, then the registries are automatically federated into a common registry.
This default federation occurs regardless of whether the LDAP registries are separate data stores or two subtrees of the same LDAP registry.
Similarly, if one or more LDAP registries are configured with one or more basic or custom registries in the `server.xml` file, then they are federated by default.

You can adjust the configuration of federated registries by enabling the link:/docs/ref/feature/#federatedRegistry-1.0.html[Federated User Registry feature] and configuring the `federatedRepository` element.
For more information, see link:/docs/ref/config/#federatedRepository.html[User Registry Federation].

== LDAP registries and the Social Media Login feature

You can use the Social Media Login feature to help manage authentication with a configured LDAP registry.
Depending how you configure the feature, users can either supply their social media credentials to authenticate or choose between their LDAP login and their social media credentials.
For more information, see the example configurations for the link:/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login feature].
