= Microservice configuration

MicroProfile Config is an API that externalizes configuration from microservices, thus keeping it separate from the source code. Microprofile Config can be used by applications as a single API that can retrieve configuration information from different sources.
When your applications are deployed as microservices, having a single place to update the configuration data of multiple microservices is useful for several reasons.
•	Building systems as collections of independent microservices increases the number of services that need to be managed.
•	 Different stages in the pipeline often use different configuration sources for a single piece of configuration data and a given component needs updating as it moves through the pipeline.
•	 Containerization of services means that even while a component is ‘live’ in production, the environment it is running in might be more dynamic and the components need configuration updates without being restarted.
The Microprofile Config API allows for a consistent means to access configuration data from pluggable configuration sources. Configuration properties can be injected using Java CDI in a form that is easy to consume. Data values and sources can vary across the devOps pipeline without code change or repackaging, and dynamic and fully typed data is catered for.


== Why it is important to configure microservices without having to update the app code?

A Micro Service can be deployed several times, using multiple versions and across multiple environments. The micro service needs to work in all those environments without the need to modify the code. Also, it is important to avoid embedding configuration in code, particularly if that config contains sensitive information such as passwords.

Configuration data can come from different locations and in different formats – system properties, system environment variables, properties files or resources, XML files or resources, and data sources. MicroProfile Config calls these sources of data ConfigSources. Since the same configuration property could be defined in multiple ConfigSources, a prioritization can be used to determine which ConfigSource is used for the property value.
Sometimes configuration values can change dynamically. Applications need to be able to access the latest values without restarting. This is particularly important for microservices running in a cloud environment. MicroProfile Config supports dynamically updating configuration values.

== What you can do with MP Config?

Here are some things you can do with a Microprofile Config API:

•	Amalgamate multiple configuration sources into a single configuration and access with one API.
•	Override configuration property values with values from configuration sources that are designated as having a higher precedence.
•	Store values in named properties files, system environment variables, or Java System properties.
•	Load `ConfigSource` resources by using a Java `ClassLoader`, either the application’s current context `ClassLoader` or a user supplied `ClassLoader`.
•	Provide values by registering a user implementation of a `ConfigSource` interface.
•	Retrieve values as Strings or as typed objects of a particular Java class by using built in or custom type Converters.
•	Discover `ConfigSource` and `Converter` implementations by using the Java `ServiceLoader` pattern.
•	Directly inject configuration property values, whether for primitives, standard types, or user supplied types, by using Java CDI (Context and Dependency Injection).
