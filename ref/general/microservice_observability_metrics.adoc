= Microservice observability with metrics

Building observability into microservices externalizes the internal status of a system to enable operations teams to monitor microservice systems more effectively. It is important that microservices are written to produce metrics that can be used by operations teams when the microservices are running in production. link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/[Microprofile Metrics] provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.

When the application is running, you can view your metrics from any browser by visiting, for example, `https://localhost:9443/metrics`. You can further narrow down the scope of the metric data by accessing the `/metrics/base`, `/metrics/application`, and `/metrics/vendor` endpoints. By default, metric data is emitted in link:https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/[Prometheus format]. Metric data can be retrieved in JSON format by configuring the `Accept` header of your request to the `application/json` value. A `GET` request returns a list of metrics, and an `OPTIONS` request returns a list of metrics with their metadata.

Operations teams can gather the metrics and store them in a database by using tools like Prometheus. They can then visualize the metrics in dashboards, such as Grafana, to analyze the data.

== Adding metrics to your applications

To add metrics to your applications, you must create and register metrics with the application registry so that they are known to the system and can be reported on from the `/metrics` endpoint. The easiest way to add metrics to your application is by using metrics annotations. MicroProfile Metrics defines annotations that enable you to quickly build metrics into your code. These metrics ultimately provide transparency for operations teams into how services are running.

== Metrics and annotations
The following examples describe several types of metrics and how their corresponding annotations are used.

=== Counters
Counter metrics are used to keep an incremental count. The initial value of the counter is set to 0. The counter metric increments each time that an annotated element is hit.

==== @Counted
This annotation is used for marking a method, constructor, or type as a counter. The counter increments monotonically, counting total invocations of the annotated method:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/no")
@Counted(name="no", displayName="No donation count", description="Number of people that declined to donate.")
public String noDonation() {
    return "Maybe next time!";
}
----

'''

=== Timers
Timer metrics are used to aggregate timing durations, in nanoseconds, and provide duration and throughput statistics.

==== @Timed
This annotation is used for marking a constructor or method as timed. The timer tracks how frequently the annotated object is started and tracks how long the invocations take to complete:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("/creditcard")
@Timed(
    name="donateAmountViaCreditCard.timer",
    displayName="Donations Via Credit Cards",
    description = "Donations that were made using a credit card")
public String donateAmountViaCreditCard(@FormParam("amount") Long amount, @FormParam("card") String card) {
 
    if (processCard(card, amount))
        return "Thanks for donating!";
 
    return "Sorry, please try again.";
}
----

'''

=== Meters
Meter metrics are used to track throughput.
A meter metric provides the following information:

* Mean throughput 
* One/five/fifteen minute exponentially weighted moving average throughput
* A count of the number of measurements

==== @Metered
This annotation is used for marking a constructor or method as metered. The meter counts the invocations of the annotated constructor or method and tracks how frequently they are called:

[source,java]
----
@Metered(displayName="Rate of donations", description="Rate of incoming donations (the instances not the amount)")
public void addDonation(Long amount) {
    totalDonations += amount;
    donations.add(amount);
    donationDistribution.update(amount);
}
----

'''

=== Gauges
Gauge metrics are implemented by the developer in a way that allows them to be sampled to obtain a particular value. For example, you might use a gauge metric to measure CPU temperature or disk usage. 

==== @Gauge
This annotation is used for marking a method as a gauge:

[source,java]
----
@Gauge(
    name="donations",
    displayName="Total Donations",
    description="Total amount of money raised for charity!",
    unit = "dollars",
    absolute=true)
public Long getTotalDonations(){
    return totalDonations;
}
----

'''

=== Concurrent Gauges
Concurrent gauge metrics are used to keep a count of concurrent invocations of an annotated element. Concurrent gauge metrics also track the high and low watermarks of each invocation. For each invocation of an annotated element, the count increments upon entry and decrements upon exit.

==== @ConcurrentGauge
This annotation is used for marking a method as a concurrent gauge. The concurrent gauge increments when the annotated method is called and decrements when the annotated method returns, counting current invocations of the annotated method:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/livestream");
@ConcurrentGauge(name = "liveStreamViewers", displayName="Donation live stream viewers", description="Number of active viewers for the donation live stream")
public void donationLiveStream() {
    launchLiveStreamConnection();
}
----

These types of metrics are available to add to your applications to make them observable. In production, operations teams can use these metrics to monitor the application, along with metrics that are automatically emitted from the JVM and the Open Liberty server runtime. If you're interested in learning more about using MicroProfile Metrics to build observability into your microservices, see the Open Liberty guide for link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[Providing metrics from a microservice].
