== Repository and proxy modifications

You can modify several behaviors of the `featureUtility` command by declaring environment variables in the shell environment or by specifying properties in the `featureUtility.properties` file that's located in the `{wlp.install.dir}/etc/` directory.
Properties that are specified in the `featureUtility.properties` file take precedence over environment variables that are declared in the shell environment.
For example, if you specify `featureLocalRepo=/usr/IBM/maven/repository` in the `featureUtility.properties` file, then any value set with the `FEATURE_LOCAL_REPO` environment variable is overriden.

It can be helpful to specify modifications to the `featureUtility` command by using properties in the `featureUtility.properties` file rather than environment variables.
You can easily see repository and proxy settings that are contained in the `featureUtility.properties` file by running the <<view-settings,`viewSettings` action>>.
Settings that are configured with environment variables don't show up with this information.

The following table lists the environment variables and their corresponding properties that you can specify to modify the `featureUtility` command:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Environment variable
|Corresponding properties
|Description

|`FEATURE_REPO_URL`
|`mavenCentralMirror.url`
|Overrides Maven Central with an on-premises Maven repository.

|`FEATURE_REPO_USER`
|`mavenCentralMirror.user`
|The username for `FEATURE_REPO_URL` user credentials.

|`FEATURE_REPO_PASSWORD`
|`mavenCentralMirror.password`
|The password for `FEATURE_REPO_URL` user credentials.

|`FEATURE_LOCAL_REPO`
|`featureLocalRepo`
|Overrides the local Maven repository.

|`http_proxy`
|`proxyHost`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUser`, and `proxyPassword`
a|Configures the outbound HTTP proxy.

|`https_proxy`
|`proxyHost`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUser`, and `proxyPassword`
a|Configures the outbound HTTPS proxy.

|===

You can also define additional remote repositories by adding the `customRepoName.url` property in the `featureUtility.properties` file.
Each repository name must be unique, and defined repositories are accessed in the order that they're specified.
If a repository requires a user name and password, also set the `customRepoName.user` and `customRepoName.password` properties.
In the following example, two custom repositories, `remoteRepo1` and `remoteRepo2`, are defined.
`remoteRepo2` is secure so it also requires a user name and password:

----
remoteRepo1.url=http://my-remote-server1/maven2
remoteRepo2.url=https://my-remote-server2/secure/maven2
remoteRepo2.user=operator
remoteRepo2.password={aes}KM8dhwcv892Ss1sawu9R+
