= Authentication in Open Liberty

In order for an application to be secure, it must be able to determine who its users are and what permissions they have. Authentication is the process by which an application confirms a user’s identity.

Applications authenticate users by collecting credentials from them, such as a username and password, and checking these credentials against a configured registry of users. There are a number of different ways that authentication can be carried out, depending on the details of an application and the resources that are available to it. For microservice-based applications, it’s important that authentication is lightweight and configurable, since any user request might need to authenticate to multiple services. For example, a user of a music streaming service might want to listen to a song, learn about the artist, and get recommendations for similar artists. Each of these tasks would require access to a different service, but having to authenticate for each of them separately uses unnecessary time and resources. Open Liberty supports a number of different strategies for single sign-on (SSO) authentication so that a user or service must authenticate only once to access the various resources in an application. For example, the Social Login feature enables users of an application that is running on Open Liberty to authenticate through their social media login. After the Open Liberty server authenticates the user, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created and added to the user’s HTTP request header. This JWT can then authenticate the user to any service in the application.

== User registries
A user registry is a database that contains information about a set of users and their associated roles. When a user requests a protected resource in an application, the user's credentials are checked against the information in one or more user registries. Open liberty supports  a basic user registry, custom user registries, and a more robust Lightweight Direct Access Protocol (LDAP) registry. Open Liberty also supports federated LDAP registries so that multiple LDAP registries can be configured together for authentication to the server.

== Single sign-on (SSO)
SSO enables users to authenticate at one location and access multiple servers or services without being repeatedly prompted to log in. SSO is especially important for microservice-based applications, where a single user request might require authentication to several different microservices. SSO for applications that run on Open Liberty is supported by using the Lightweight Third Party Access (LTPA) protocol. The LTPA protocol uses cryptographic keys to share user data between servers that use the same user registry. When the appSecurity-2.0 (or later) feature is enabled in Open Liberty, LTPA keys are automatically created if they do not exist.

When a user authenticates to one Open Liberty server, an SSO token is created for that user and is put in a cookie. The cookie is then sent to the HTTP client, for example, a browser. If the same user makes a request to access another application that is on a different server, but in the same SSO configuration, the cookie is sent along with the request. The receiving server uses the LTPA keys to decrypt the users credentials from the token in the cookie. If the receiving server can validate the token, the user is authenticated without being prompted for another login. If the token cannot be validated (for example, it cannot decrypt or verify the token because of an LTPA key mismatch), the user is prompted to enter the credential information again.

Open Liberty supports the following options for SSO authentication:

=== Open ID Connect (OIDC)

OIDC is a popular internet SSO protocol that works well with cloud-native applications. This protocol enables a client application to request the identity of the user as an ID token in a standardized, REST-like manner. The client application, or Relying Party, requests information about a user from an authorization server, known as an OpenID Connect Provider. Users can implement a single account with an OpenID Provider to authenticate themselves with any Relying Party, without having to manage unique accounts for each entity.

=== Social media login
Users can authenticate to websites that are hosted on the Liberty server by logging in with their social media accounts. When the `socialLogin-1.0` feature is enabled, login with Facebook, Twitter, Google, and GitHub is automatically configured. You can also define your own configuration for any social media platform that is based on the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect 1.0 standards.

=== Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0)
SAML Web Browser SSO enables web applications to delegate user authentication to a SAML identity provider instead of a configured user registry.

=== Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO)
With SPNEGO SSO, users log in to the Microsoft Domain controller once to access and move between protected resources on Open Liberty servers without getting prompted for additional logins.


== JAAS Authentication with Open Liberty

Open Liberty relies on the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) framework to determine a user's identity and access roles. JAAS authentication is suited to microservice-based applications because it separates the authentication process from the rest of the application so that authentication can be managed independently. JAAS is pluggable: new or updated authentication processes can be plugged in to an application without otherwise modifying the application itself.

The JAAS framework defines a `Subject` object to represent the source of a request to an application. The subject can be any entity that makes a request, such as a user or another microservice. The subject contains a set of principals, or details about the identity of the entity that made the request, which is used for authentication. The subject also contains sets of credentials, or security attributes that are used for authorization. By creating a subject to represent a user or service, Open Liberty provides an efficient and easily configurable means for authentication data to pass between microservices in an application.

With JAAS in Open Liberty, each stage in the authentication process operates independently and can be updated or reconfigured with minimal impact on the other stages in the process. The `LoginContext` class determines the methods that are used for authentication, according to the `LoginModule` interfaces that are configured. Each `LoginModule` interface represents a particular type authentication service. For example, one `LoginModule` interface can handle basic username and password authentication, while another  processes SSO tokens.

`LoginModule` interfaces communicate with the user by using a `CallbackHandler` interface. The `CallbackHandler` interface can both gather authentication data from the user (such as a username and password) and return information from the `LoginModule` interface to the user (such as login status). Since the particular `CallbackHandler` interface is specified by the application, the authentication method (or `LoginModule`) remains independent from whatever ways the user interacts with the application. For example, one `CallbackHandler` interface in an application might display a login window for the user, while another might prompt the user to log in from the command line. Either of these `CallbackHandler` interfaces might interact with the `LoginModule` that processes username and password authentication.
