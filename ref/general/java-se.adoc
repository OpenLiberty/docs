= Java SE support

Open Liberty requires a Java SE runtime. A Java SE runtime, also known as a Java Runtime Environment or a Java Developer Kit (JDK), provides the tools to develop, run, and monitor your Java application.

Always run Open Liberty on the most recent service release of your chosen Java version. A new version of Java is released every six months. Unless the prior version is designated as a Long Term Support (LTS) release, it no longer receives service updates for function and security. Currently, the only LTS releases are Java SE 8 and 11. Whenever a non-LTS release is replaced by the next version, the Open Liberty project no longer validates the runtime against the older version.

== Java SE 8
Open Liberty runs on any recent Java SE 8 release from IBM, Oracle, or AdoptOpenJDK. The minimum supported level is Java SE 8u25.

== Java SE 11
Open Liberty runs on Java SE 11.0.3 or newer. Keep in mind, if you download your Java SDK from https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9[AdoptOpenJDK], link:https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[Eclipse OpenJ9] has a better memory footprint and startup profile than link:https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/[HotSpot].
For more information, see https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/02/06/java-11.html[Open Liberty and Java 11]. 

Due to differences between Java SE 8 and Java SE 11, an Open Liberty application that runs on Java SE 8 might not run on Java SE 11. For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/migrate/index.html#JSMIG-GUID-C25E2B1D-6C24-4403-8540-CFEA875B994A[Oracle Java SE 11 migration guide].

== Java SE 14
Open Liberty runs on any recent Java SE 14 release from AdoptOpenJDK, OpenJDK, or Oracle. Java SE 14 is not a long-term supported release. Standard support is scheduled to end in September 2020. Keep in mind, if you download your Java SDK from https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk14&jvmVariant=openj9[AdoptOpenJDK], link:https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[Eclipse OpenJ9] has a better memory footprint and startup profile than link:https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/[HotSpot].
