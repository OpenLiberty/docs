= Java SE support

Open Liberty requires a Java SE runtime. A Java SE runtime, also known as a Java Runtime Environment or a Java Developer Kit (JDK), provides the tools to develop, run, and monitor your Java application. Open Liberty runs on any of the Java runtimes listed in the following sections. 


Always run Open Liberty on the most recent release of Java that is available. The following sections provide details about different versions of Java SE support for Open Liberty.

== Java SE 8
Open Liberty runs on any recent Java SE 8 release from IBM, Oracle, or AdoptOpenJDK. The minimum supported level for Oracle Java is Java SE 8u25.

== Java SE 11
Open Liberty runs on Java SE 11.0.3 or newer. Keep in mind, if you download your Java SDK from https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9[AdoptOpenJDK], link:https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[Eclipse OpenJ9] has a better memory footprint and startup profile than link:https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/[Hotspot].
For more information, see https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/02/06/java-11.html[Open Liberty and Java 11]. 

Due to differences between Java SE 8 and Java SE 11, an Open Liberty application that runs on Java SE 8 might not run on Java SE 11. For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/migrate/index.html#JSMIG-GUID-C25E2B1D-6C24-4403-8540-CFEA875B994A[Oracle Java SE 11 migration guide].

== Java SE 13
Open Liberty runs on any recent Java SE 13 release from AdoptOpenJDK, OpenJDK, or Oracle. Java SE 13 is not a long-term supported release. Standard support is scheduled to end in September 2020.
If you download your Java SDK from https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9[AdoptOpenJDK], use https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk13&jvmVariant=openj9[Eclipse OpenJ9] instead of Hotspot. https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8226690[A bug exists in Hotspot] that affects JDK 13 and 14. This bug is fixed only in JDK 14.
