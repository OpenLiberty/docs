= Runnable JAR files

// Pithy single sentence description of the command.
Runnable JAR files contain applications, server configurations, and a Liberty installation.

// If relevant, more info.
For information about packaging the JAR, see link:/docs/ref/command/#server-package.html[server package].

When a JAR file runs, it gets extracted to a temporary location and the server runs in the foreground. By default, files are extracted to `wlpExtract/<jar file name>_nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn` in the user home directory. You can control the output location by using the `WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_ROOT` or `WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_DIR` environment variables (see <<Environment variables>>).

== Environment variables
For information about specifying environment variables, see link:/docs/ref/config/[Server configuration].

|===
|Environment variable name
|Description

|`WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_ROOT`
|Extracts the JAR file to the `${WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_ROOT}/<jar file name>_nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn` directory.

|`WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_DIR`
|Extracts the JAR file to the `${WLP_JAR_EXTRACT_DIR}` directory.

|`WLP_OUTPUT_DIR`
|Writes Liberty server output files to the `${WLP_OUTPUT_DIR}` directory.

By default, server output is written to the extraction directory, which is deleted when the server stops. If you want to save the output, specify a durable output location by using the `WLP_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable before you start the server.

|`WLP_JAR_DEBUG`
|Runs Liberty server by using `server debug <server name>` instead of `server run <server name>`. You can run the Liberty server in debug mode if you set the `WLP_JAR_DEBUG` environment variable before you start the server.

|`WLP_JAR_ENABLE_2PC`
|Set to value `true` to enable two-phase commit transactions when the runnable JAR file runs.

By default, two-phase commit transactions are disabled because the transaction logs are in the expansion directory and are deleted when the Liberty server stops. Therefore, transaction recovery is not possible.

To enable two-phase commit transactions, configure the transaction log to be in a durable location in the file system or an RDBMS, and set the `WLP_JAR_ENABLE_2PC` environment variable.

To configure the transaction log, use either the `transactionLogDirectory` or `dataSourceRef` attributes on the transaction element in your `server.xml` configuration.

|`WLP_JAR_CYGWIN`
|Set to value `true` if you are running the JAR file under CYGWIN. This variable causes the Liberty server JAR runner to do UNIX-style file and UNIX-style process handling when it is running in the CYGWIN environment.

Run under the bash shell, not mintty. Automatic extraction file deletion occurs only when you run under the bash shell. You can run under mintty, but you must delete the extraction files manually. Mintty does not forward the necessary signal that is required to trigger Java shutdown hooks.
