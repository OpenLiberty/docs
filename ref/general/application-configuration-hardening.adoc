= Application configuration security hardening

Before you can run an application in production, carefully harden its configuration by following some best practices.
If your application isn't properly secured, external users might derive or inherit unauthorized privileges when they run it.

These unauthorized privileges can give users unauthorized access to sensitive information about your application and other users.
By hardening your application configuration, you can prevent unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.

== User roles and access
Understanding the roles and mappings of users is key to securely configuring your application for production use.
For more information about how to map users to roles and groups, see link:/docs/ref/general/#authorization.html[Authorization].

If you don’t configure user roles in the `server.xml` file, by default, Open Liberty uses the group names that a user is attached to as the role names for the user.
For conflicts in the role mapping of a servlet between the `web.xml` file and annotations in the application, the configuration in the `web.xml` file takes precedence.

If a conflict exists between the `ibm-application-bnd.xml` and `server.xml` files, then the configuration in the `server.xml` file takes precedence.
If the information that is being specified can have multiple values, the values from the `server.xml` file are added to the values from the application.
For example, if the `ibm-application-bnd.xml` file defines two security roles and the `server.xml` file defines one role, all three security roles are used.
A security role that is defined in the `server.xml` file can have the same name as a security role that is defined in the `ibm-application-bnd.xml` file.
In this situation, the security role from the `server.xml` file overwrites the security role from the `ibm-application-bnd.xml` file.

When the role-mapping binding information isn’t specified for the application in the `ibm-application-bnd.xml` or `server.xml` files, the group name and role name must be the same.
For example, if the role name is `manager`, then a user who belongs to a `manager` group has access to that resource.

== Web server document root
Avoid placing sensitive information in the WAR root.
The web container serves any files that are found in the root of the WAR file, which is okay if the root contains only servable content.
However, because the web container serves files from the WAR root, it must never contain any content that you don't want users to see, including property or class files.
If you must place such information in the WAR file, place it in the `WEB-INF` directory, as allowed by the servlet specification.
Information in this directory is never served by the web container.

== Secure servlets
Servlets can be served by class name or with a normal URL alias.
By default, Open Liberty does not allow servlets to be served by class name.
Instead of defining a mapping for each servlet, a single generic URI, such as `/servlet`, serves all servlets.
The component of the path after the base is assumed to be the class name for the servlet.
For example, the `/servlet/com.ibm.sample.MyServlet` path refers to the `com.ibm.sample.MyServlet` servlet class.

You can serve servlets by class name by setting the `serveServletsByClassnameEnabled` property to `true` in the `ibm-web-ext.xml` file of the application.
For production purposes, don't enable this property.
Enabling the `serveServletsByClassnameEnabled` property makes it possible for anyone that knows the class name of any servlet to directly start it.

=== Servlet aliases
Servlets are secured by URLs.
Each URL that is secured must be specified in the `web.xml` file that describes the application.
A servlet can have more than one alias. For example, multiple URLs can access the same servlet class.
If a servlet has more than one alias, it can be easy to forget to secure an alias.
Because Open Liberty secures URLs and not the underlying classes, if just one servlet URL is insecure, an intruder might be able to bypass security.
To alleviate this risk, use wildcards to secure servlets wherever possible.
If using wildcards isn't appropriate, carefully double check your `web.xml` file before deployment.

When you specify authorization constraints for servlets, ensure that you either list no methods or carefully list all the methods for a servlet, including GET, POST, PUT, and HEAD methods.
If you are using multiple constraints, list all the methods.

Specify the `<deny-uncovered-http-methods>` element in the `web.xml` file.
When the `<deny-uncovered-http-methods>` element is specified, the container denies any uncovered HTTP methods.
A `403 (SC_FORBIDDEN)` status code is returned by the denied HTTP methods.
You can also use the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#webApplication.html#webservices-bnd/http-publishing/webservice-security/security-constraint/web-resource-collection&expand=true[`<http-method-omission>` element] to specify an HTTP method to which a security constraint doesn't apply.
In the following secure example, the `<deny-uncovered-http-methods>` element is specified in the `web.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<servlet-mapping id="ServletMapping_1">
		<servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/MyURLPattern</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<deny-uncovered-http-methods/>

<!-- SECURITY CONSTRAINTS -->
<security-constraint id="SecurityConstraint_1">
		<web-resource-collection id="WebResourceCollection_1">
			<web-resource-name>Protected with Employee or Manager roles</web-resource-name>
			<url-pattern>/MyURLPattern</url-pattern>
			<http-method>GET</http-method>
			<http-method>POST</http-method>
		</web-resource-collection>
		<auth-constraint id="AuthConstraint_1">
			<role-name>Employee</role-name>
			<role-name>Manager</role-name>
		</auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
----
{empty} +

A message is logged in the `messages.log` file for each URL pattern in each servlet.
These messages indicate the uncovered methods and whether those methods are accessible:

* If the `<deny-uncovered-http-methods>` element is specified in the `web.xml` file, the messages indicate that the uncovered methods are unprotected and not accessible, as shown in the following example:
+
----
For URL MyURLPattern in servlet MyServlet, the following HTTP methods are uncovered, and not accessible: DELETE OPTIONS HEAD PUT TRACE
----

* If the `<deny-uncovered-http-methods>` element isn't specified in the `web.xml` file, the messages indicate that the uncovered methods are unprotected and accessible, as shown in the following example:
+
----
For URL MyURLPattern in servlet MyServlet, the following HTTP methods are uncovered, and accessible: DELETE OPTIONS HEAD PUT TRACE
----

== File serving and directory browsing
You can further limit the risk of serving inappropriate content by disabling file serving and directory browsing in your web applications.
Set the following property in the `ibm-web-ext.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<enable-directory-browsing value="false" />
----

== Confidential transport guarantee
To ensure that applications run only over secure HTTP connections, specify the `transport-guarantee` element with a value of `CONFIDENTIAL` in the `web.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<user-data-constraint>
  <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
</user-data-constraint>
----
