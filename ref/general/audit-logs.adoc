:seo-title: Audit support for server runtime environment and applications - OpenLiberty.io
:seo-description:
= Audit logs

The Audit (audit-1.0) feature enables audit support for the server runtime environment and applications. You can use the audit feature to confirm the effectiveness of the existing environment configuration and identify areas where improvement to the configuration might be needed.

A runtime environment provides a state that contains the resources that are needed to support the processes that help to run an application. The data that is generated by applications in the server runtime environment is transmitted by the audit file handler and stored in audit logs. Audit logs provide a record of what action was conducted on the environment, when the action was conducted, why the action was conducted, and who is responsible for the action. All relevant data that is associated with the action is included in the audit event.

With the Audit feature, you can report and track audit events to ensure the integrity of your configured environment. The audit outcome helps to determine the status of the audit event after the associated actions are completed.


=== Audit events

An audit event is any action that occurs within the environment that can be represented by the following components:

* Who initiated the action
* What initiated the action
* When the action was initiated
* On what the action was initiated
* Where the action was initiated
* From where did the action initiate
* Where did the action target

=== Audit outcomes


An audit outcome is the final result of an audit event. The final result of audit events is specified as one of the following outcome types: SUCCESS, FAILURE, ERROR, REDIRECT, DENIED, INFO, and WARNING.


===  Audit handler

The audit handler pushes the audit outcome and emits audit events to a backend repository. A repository can be an on-premises flat file, a database, or the cloud. An audit file handler is provided by default to emit audit data to an on-premises `audit.log` file. When the maximum number of archived audit logs is reached, after the `audit.log` file that is being written to reaches its maximum size, then the oldest archived audit log is overwritten. By default, the audit file handler writes audit records to an audit log file until the file reaches 20 MB size. The audit log file is then archived and a new audit log file is started. The maximum number of archived audit log files, by default, is 100 after which the oldest archived log file is overwritten. To configure the audit file handler, you can configure the `auditFileHandler` element in the `server.xml` file. For more information, see https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/feature/#audit-1.0.html[Audit 1.0]. The audit file handler can be customized by specifying any of the config attributes, along with the `auditFileHandler` element. For more information, see link:https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#auditFileHandler.html[Default Audit File Handler].


==== Successful form login flow to access a servlet application example

The following example demonstrates audit events that are logged for a successful form login with security authentication that is followed by role-based authorization to a web servlet application.

Security authentication redirects the user to a login form for entering an ID and password. The `session` field in the audit event records the HTTP session for this user interaction:

==== Failed form login authentication example

The following example demonstrates the audit events that are logged for a failed form login by a user who cannot be authenticated against the user registry.

Security authentication redirects the user to a login form for entering an ID and password. The `session` field in the audit event records the HTTP session for this user interaction.


After the login form prompts the user to enter the user ID and password, the `baduser` user ID fails authentication against the user registry and the user login is denied:
