= Single sign-on (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) enables users to sign in to applications by using one account instead of creating an account specifically for each application that they want to use. By configuring SSO for your applications, you can simplify the registrations and logins for your users.

As the developer of the application, you are not responsible for securing and maintaining users' personal information. Open Liberty supports several commonly used methods of implementing SSO in applications; the method you choose to use depends on the needs of your organization.

You must also configure Transport Security Layer (TLS) to encrypt communications between services for any SSO method that you choose so that the authentication tokens are not intercepted during transmission. For more information, see https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/general/#secure-communication-tls.html[Secure communication with Transport Layer Security (TLS)].

*LC: for each method, find a credible source of further information where the reader can learn more about the method and link to it from the first mention of the method in its section. See the JWT section for example.*

== Social media login

//intro to method and when you should use it
link:https://auth0.com/learn/social-login/[Social Media Login] is a form of SSO that enables users to sign in to applications by using their existing social media account instead of creating an account specifically for the application. When you enable Social Media Login, the user accesses an application and selects a social media platform from a form, then uses their existing account on that platform to log in. You can enable Social Media Login for any social media platform that uses the OAuth or OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard for authentication.

During the OpenID Connect authentication process, a browser accesses a protected application and is redirected to the OpenID provider, an authorization server that implements OpenID Connect. The OpenID provider interacts with the user to authenticate them. After authentication, the user’s browser is redirected back to the application. The application or its container then contacts the OpenID provider and obtains a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the user, and completes authentication and authorization. If successful, the user is granted access to the application. The application can access the claims that are sent in the JWT. If you use the Social Media Login feature, the entire OpenID Connect authorization process is handled by the social media platform, which makes the process simpler.

//How to use it
To configure Social Media Login for your application, enable the feature:socialLogin[] feature.

== JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

//intro to method and when you should use it
link:https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Token (JWT)] is a standard that is used to propagate the user identity that is established by SSO between different microservice applications. By configuring SSO user authentication with a JWT, you can manage the identity that is shared between applications.

After the user's identity is established with an SSO method, such as Social Media Login, you can use the JWT to propagate the identity to back-end services. The JWT uses claims to transfer authentication and group membership information about a user between services. The claims can verify who the user is, when the user requests were made, and any other types of information that the user agreed to be handled by you. Each consumer of the token can verify that they can trust the claims in it, by verifying that they trust the issuer’s signature of the token. After the consumer verifies the signature, they know that the content of the token hasn’t been altered since it was created. This JWT format allows each of the involved parties to easily agree on a specific set of claims that facilitate the propagation of the user’s identity. This propagation of the user’s identity can be further defined by the MicroProfile JWT feature.

MicroProfile JSON Web Tokens extend the capabilities of the standard JWT format to verify claims between two services and make accessing claim information simpler for application developers. MicroProfile JWT defines how a JWT interacts with Java EE and Jakarta EE container security so that the JWT is easily used with JAX-RS applications. For more information about using JWTs to secure JAX-RS applications, see link:/guides/microprofile-jwt.html[Guide:  Securing microservices with JSON Web Tokens].

The MicroProfile JSON Web Tokens format contains required claims, which must be specified to propagate user identity. A claim is a piece of information that is asserted about a subject that is represented as a name-value pair, which consists of a claim name and a claim value. The following example shows the required claims that are specified in a JSON file:

[source, javascript]

*insert example claim from https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/general/#sso-config-jwt.html here but properly indented and with syntax highlighting - if `[source,json]` isn't displaying anything other than the blue on blue text, try using `[source,javascript]` instead and see if that works better.*

//How to use it
To configure MicroProfile JSON Web Tokens for your JAX-RS application, enable the feature:mpJwt[] feature.



== SPNEGO

//intro to method and when you should use it
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/6.4/html/security_guide/about_spnego[SPNEGO] enables users to log in to applications by using their MicroSoft Windows account login instead of needing to use a separate account to log into their Windows operating system. SPNEGO can be used to provide SSO in your application as long as the organization uses Active Directory. SPNEGO can also be configured to work on Linux operating systems.

//How to use it

== SAML

//intro to method and when you should use it

*LC: This needs to explain better the things that are useful to the developer to be able to use it. Why would a developer choose to use it for their app (eg what does the company need to have to be able to use it?)?*

link:https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-saml/[SAML] is a standard that represents and exchanges user identity, authentication, and attribute information between services. When integrated with SSO, SAML enables web applications to delegate user authentication to a centralized location for enterprises to manage and control identities. Open Liberty supports the SAML Web browser SSO profile with HTTP post binding, single logout, and SAML metadata. SAML metadata is configuration data that is required to automatically negotiate agreements between the service provider and the identity provider to help ensure secure authentication. *Does the developer need to know about SAML metadata? If so, include a brief explanation but make it applicable instead of abstract.*

You can configure Open Liberty to enable SAML single logout, which is a near-simultaneous logout of a user from a specific authentication session and from all active service provider sessions that are associated with the authentication session. Single logout can be initiated by both the service provider and the identity provider.

//How to use it
To configure SAML for your application, enable the feature:samlWeb[] feature.

== LTPA

//intro to method and when you should use it
link:https://www.miniorange.com/ltpa-authentication[LTPA] provides a method of SSO configuration support to authenticate users when they are accessing applications. To perform authentication, a token is generated that contains details about the user identity. When authentication is successful, the LTPA token passes to other servers through cookies for web resources when SSO is enabled.  LTPA cookies enable a user to authenticate their identity only once when they are connected to an application. After the connection to the application is established, the user can access resources in other applications that exist on the same server without getting prompted to authenticate. In Open Liberty, LTPA is configured by default when the Application Security feature is enabled.

//How to use it
*LC: What does "when security is enabled" mean? Does that mean the developer needs to enable the App Security feature? Anything else?*



*delete https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/general/#sso-config-ltpa.html but move the config examples to the LTPA autogen feature doc.*
