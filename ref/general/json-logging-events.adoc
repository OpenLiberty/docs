:seo-title: JSON logging events - OpenLiberty.io
:seo-description: The JSON logging events that can be captured from the Open Liberty server runtime environment and applications.
= JSON logging reference list

Open Liberty generates JSON logging events from the server runtime and applications. You can use these events to gather and analyze data that can help to better understand the behavior of applications.

The following types of events are generated by Open Liberty:

* <<Message log events, Message log events>>
* <<Trace log events, Trace log events>>
* <<FFDC log events, FFDC log events>>
* <<HTTP access log events, HTTP access log events>>
* <<Supported audit events and their audit data, Audit Events>>

=== JMX_MBEAN

You can use the JMX_MBEAN event to perform JMX_MBEAN operations. The following table provides the fields for the JMX_MBEAN event and a description of each field.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|FIELDS |DESCRIPTION
|eventName |Name of the audit event
|eventSequenceNumber |Sequence number of the audit event
|eventTime |Time the event occurred
|initiator.host.address |Host address of the initiator of the event
|initiator.host.agent |Name of monitoring agent associated with initiator
|observer.id |Identifier of the observer of the event
|observer.name |Name of the observer of the event: `JMXService`
|observer.typeURI |Unique URI of the observer of the event: `service/server`
|outcome |Outcome of the event
|reason.reasonCode |A value indicating the underlying success or error code for the outcome. In general, a value of 200 means success
|reason.reasonType |A value indicating the underlying mechanism, i.e., and HTTP(S), JMS, EJB, etc. associated with the request, or the state behind the outcome
|target.id |Identifier of the target of the action
|target.jmx.mbean.action |MBean action being performed: query, create, invoke
|target.jmx.mbean.name |Name of the MBean being acted upon
|target.realm |Realm name associated with the target
|target.typeURI |Unique URI of the target of the event: `server/mbean`
