= JMX metrics reference list

With Open Liberty, you can access Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics.
JMX metrics are provided by MXBeans and can be used with JConsole or other JMX-based tools.

Enable the link:/docs/ref/feature/#monitor-1.0.html[Perfomance Monitoring feature] to monitor JMX metrics for your Open Liberty runtime environment.
The following sections list the JMX metrics that are available for different monitoring capabilities:

* <<jvm-stats,JVM monitoring>>
* <<request-timing-stats,Request monitoring>>
* <<servlet-stats,Servlet monitoring>>
* <<threadpool-stats,Thread pool monitoring>>
* <<web-service-stats,JAX-WS monitoring>>
* <<session-stats,Session monitoring>>
* <<connection-pool-stats,Connection pool monitoring>>
* <<sip-application,SIP application monitoring>>
